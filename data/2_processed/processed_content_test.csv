The test, which is designed to rule out cognitive decline caused by Alzheimer’s disease, is the first blood test cleared for use in primary-care settings but not a first for Alzheimer’s.Elecsys pTau181 — developed by two pharmaceutical companies, Roche in Basel, Switzerland and Eli Lilly in Indianapolis, Indiana — measures a specific phosphorylated form of tau, known as pTau181 in blood plasma. The test quantifies how much tau protein in the body has been modified as a result of Alzheimer’s disease.In a press release on 13 October, Roche reported that in a clinical trial of 312 participants, the Elecsys pTau181 test was correctly able to rule out Alzheimer’s 97.9% of the time. The test uses a negative predictive value and helps to rule out Alzheimer’s in individuals with cognitive decline, rather than giving a positive indication that someone has the disease.Faster, cheaper, better: the rise of blood tests for Alzheimer’s“Numerous research studies have shown that these blood signatures have high concordance. They agree really well with the gold standard biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease, which we have been using in specialized settings for many years”, says Ashvini Keshavan, a neurologist and biomarker researcher at University College London.However, without full access to the trial data, Keshavan says it’s difficult to fully assess how accurate the test is. “It would be important to see the sensitivity, specificity and positive prediction values to assess the accuracy of this test.”How accurate is the blood test?Alzheimer’s disease pathology is characterized by the build-up of sticky amyloid-β plaques and tangles of tau proteins in brain tissue. Both proteins disrupt brain function, lead to neuron death and are the causes of cognitive decline associated with the disease1.One other Alzheimer’s blood test has already been approved to measure these biomarkers in individuals’ blood. In May, Lumipulse, developed by biotechnology firm Fujirebio in Tokyo, gained approval from the FDA. This test measures the ratio of two proteins: pTau217 and amyloid-β (1–42). Alicia Algeciras-Schimnich, a clinical chemist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, says the two tests work slightly differently — with the Lumipulse test able to both positively test for and rule out the presence of Alzheimer’s pathology.During a trial of 499 people, 97% of individuals who tested negative for the disease on the Lumipulse test had their results confirmed by follow-up diagnostics tests, which measure the levels of these proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue. Almost 92% of those with a positive Lumipulse result for Alzheimer’s disease had positive follow-up tests.Coloured magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of a healthy brain (left) and a brain with aggregations of tau proteins (right).

Individuals can fall into a ‘grey zone’ and require further testing to provide a clear diagnosis.More than 30% of all samples that were analysed with a pTau217 test developed by Quanterix, a life-sciences company in Billerica, Massachusetts, fell into this grey zone2. A similar number has not been reported for the Elecsys or Lumipulse tests.Will the tests change Alzheimer’s diagnostics? Enjoying our latest content?

Now researchers can start with the structures and reverse-engineer the rules. Comment 6 Save Article Read Later Neural cellular automata self-assemble into whatever shape you desire. Michael Waraksa for Quanta Magazine Introduction By George Musser Contributing Writer September 10, 2025 artificial intelligence computer science games machine learning patterns All topics Alexander Mordvintsev showed me two clumps of pixels on his screen. They pulsed, grew and blossomed into monarch butterflies. As the two butterflies grew, they smashed into each other, and one got the worst of it; its wing withered away. But just as it seemed like a goner, the mutilated butterfly did a kind of backflip and grew a new wing like a salamander regrowing a lost leg. Mordvintsev (opens a new tab), a research scientist at Google in Zurich, had not deliberately bred his virtual butterflies to regenerate lost body parts; it happened spontaneously. That was his first inkling, he said, that he was onto something. His project built on a decades-old tradition of creating cellular automata: miniature, chessboard-like computational worlds governed by bare-bones rules. The most famous, the Game of Life, first popularized in 1970, has captivated generations of computer scientists, biologists and physicists, who see it as a metaphor for how a few basic laws of physics can give rise to the vast diversity of the natural world. In 2020, Mordvintsev brought this into the era of deep learning by creating neural cellular automata, or NCAs. Instead of starting with rules and applying them to see what happened, his approach started with a desired pattern and figured out what simple rules would produce it. “I wanted to reverse this process: to say that here is my objective,” he said. With this inversion, he has made it possible to do “complexity engineering,” as the physicist and cellular-automata researcher Stephen Wolfram proposed in 1986 (opens a new tab) — namely, to program the building blocks of a system so that they will self-assemble into whatever form you want. “Imagine you want to build a cathedral, but you don’t design a cathedral,” Mordvintsev said. “You design a brick. What shape should your brick be that, if you take a lot of them and shake them long enough, they build a cathedral for you?” Such a brick sounds almost magical, but biology is replete with examples of basically that. A starling murmuration or ant colony acts as a coherent whole, and scientists have postulated simple rules that, if each bird or ant follows them, explain the collective behavior. Similarly, the cells of your body play off one another to shape themselves into a single organism. NCAs are a model for that process, except that they start with the collective behavior and automatically arrive at the rules. Alexander Mordvintsev created complex cell-based digital systems that use only neighbor-to-neighbor communication. Courtesy of Alexander Mordvintsev The possibilities this presents are potentially boundless. If biologists can figure out how Mordvintsev’s butterfly can so ingeniously regenerate a wing, maybe doctors can coax our bodies to regrow a lost limb. For engineers, who often find inspiration in biology, these NCAs are a potential new model for creating fully distributed computers that perform a task without central coordination. In some ways, NCAs may be innately better at problem-solving than neural networks. Life’s Dreams Mordvintsev was born in 1985 and grew up in the Russian city of Miass, on the eastern flanks of the Ural Mountains. He taught himself to code on a Soviet-era IBM PC clone by writing simulations of planetary dynamics, gas diffusion and ant colonies. “The idea that you can create a tiny universe inside your computer and then let it run, and have this simulated reality where you have full control, always fascinated me,” he said. He landed a job at Google’s lab in Zurich in 2014, just as a new image-recognition technology based on multilayer, or “deep,” neural networks was sweeping the tech industry. For all their power, these systems were (and arguably still are) troublingly inscrutable. “I realized that, OK, I need to figure out how it works,” he said. He came up with “deep dreaming,” a process that takes whatever patterns a neural network discerns in an image, then exaggerates them for effect. For a while, the phantasmagoria that resulted — ordinary photos turned into a psychedelic trip of dog snouts, fish scales and parrot feathers — filled the internet. Mordvintsev became an instant software celebrity. Among the many scientists who reached out to him was Michael Levin (opens a new tab) of Tufts University, a leading developmental biologist. If neural networks are inscrutable, so are biological organisms, and Levin was curious whether something like deep dreaming might help to make sense of them, too. Levin’s email reawakened Mordvintsev’s fascination with simulating nature, especially with cellular automata. Share this article Facebook Copied! Copy link (opens a new tab) Email Pocket Reddit Ycombinator Newsletter Get Quanta Magazine delivered to your inbox Subscribe now Recent newsletters (opens a new tab) From a single cell, this neural cellular automata transforms into the shape of a lizard. The core innovation made by Mordvintsev, Levin and two other Google researchers, Ettore Randazzo and Eyvind Niklasson, was to use a neural network to define the physics of the cellular automaton. In the Game of Life (or just “Life” as it’s commonly called), each cell in the grid is either alive or dead and, at each tick of the simulation clock, either spawns, dies or stays as is. The rules for how each cell behaves appear as a list of conditions: “If a cell has more than three neighbors, it dies,” for example. In Mordvintsev’s system, the neural network takes over that function. Based on the current condition of a cell and its neighbors, the network tells you what will happen to that cell. The same type of network is used to classify an image as, say, a dog or cat, but here it classifies the state of cells. Moreover, you don’t need to specify the rules yourself; the neural network can learn them during the training process. To start training, you seed the automaton with a single “live” cell. Then you use the network to update the cells over and over again for dozens to thousands of times. You compare the resulting pattern to the desired one. The first time you do this, the result will look nothing like what you intended. So you adjust the neural network’s parameters, rerun the network to see whether it does any better now, make further adjustments, and repeat. If rules exist that can generate the pattern, this procedure should eventually find them. Math’s ‘Game of Life’ Reveals Long-Sought Repeating Patterns games Math’s ‘Game of Life’ Reveals Long-Sought Repeating Patterns January 18, 2024 Comment Save Article Read Later The adjustments can be made using either backpropagation, the technique that powers most modern deep learning, or a genetic algorithm, an older technique that mimics Darwinian evolution. Backpropagation is much faster, but it doesn’t work in every situation, and it required Mordvintsev to adapt the traditional design of cellular automata. Cell states in Life are binary — dead or alive — and transitions from one state to the other are abrupt jumps, whereas backpropagation demands that all transitions be smooth. So he adopted an approach developed by, among others, Bert Chan at Google’s Tokyo lab in the mid-2010s. Mordvintsev made the cell states continuous values, anything from 0 to 1, so they are never strictly dead or alive, but always somewhere in between. Mordvintsev also found that he had to endow each cell with “hidden” variables, which do not indicate whether that cell is alive or dead, or what type of cell it is, but nonetheless guide its development. “If you don’t do that, it just doesn’t work,” he said. In addition, he noted that if all the cells updated at the same time, as in Life, the resulting patterns lacked the organic quality he was seeking. “It looked very unnatural,” he said. So he began to update at random intervals. Finally, he made his neural network fairly beefy — 8,000 parameters. On the face of it, that seems perplexing. A direct translation of Life into a neural network would require just 25 parameters, according to simulations done in 2020 by Jacob Springer, who is now a doctoral student at Carnegie Mellon University, and Garrett Kenyon of Los Alamos National Laboratory. But deep learning practitioners often have to supersize their networks, because learning to perform a task is harder than actually performing it. Moreover, extra parameters mean extra capability. Although Life can generate immensely rich behaviors, Mordvintsev’s monsters reached another level entirely. Fixer Upper The paper that introduced NCAs to the world in 2020 included an applet (opens a new tab) that generated the image of a green lizard. If you swept your mouse through the lizard’s body, you left a trail of erased pixels, but the animal pattern soon rebuilt itself. The power of NCAs not just to create patterns, but to re-create them if they got damaged, entranced biologists. “NCAs have an amazing potential for regeneration,” said Ricard Solé of the Institute of Evolutionary Biology in Barcelona, who was not directly involved in the work. The butterfly and lizard images are not realistic animal simulations; they do not have hearts, nerves or muscles. They are simply colorful patterns of cells in the shape of an animal. But Levin and others said they do capture key aspects of morphogenesis, the process whereby biological cells form themselves into tissues and bodies. Each cell in a cellular automaton responds only to its neighbors; it does not fall into place under the direction of a master blueprint. Broadly, the same is true of living cells. And if cells can self-organize, it stands to reason that they can self-reorganize. Cut off the tail of an NCA lizard and the form will regenerate itself. Sometimes, Mordvintsev found, regeneration came for free. If the rules shaped single pixels into a lizard, they also shaped a lizard with a big gash through it into an intact animal again. Other times, he expressly trained his network to regenerate. He deliberately damaged a pattern and tweaked the rules until the system was able to recover. Redundancy was one way to achieve robustness. For example, if trained to guard against damage to the animal’s eyes, a system might grow backup copies. “It couldn’t make eyes stable enough, so they started proliferating — like, you had three eyes,” he said. A kind of computer that looks like an NCA instead would be a vastly more efficient kind of computer. Blaise Agüera y Arcas Sebastian Risi (opens a new tab), a computer scientist at the IT University of Copenhagen, has sought to understand what exactly gives NCAs their regenerative powers. One factor, he said, is the unpredictability that Mordvintsev built into the automaton through features such as random update intervals. This unpredictability forces the system to develop mechanisms to cope with whatever life throws at it, so it will take the loss of a body part in stride. A similar principle holds for natural species. “Biological systems are so robust because the substrate they work on is so noisy,” Risi said. Last year, Risi, Levin and Ben Hartl, a physicist at Tufts and the Vienna University of Technology, used NCAs to investigate how noise leads to robustness. They added one feature to the usual NCA architecture: a memory. This system could reproduce a desired pattern either by adjusting the network parameters or by storing it pixel-by-pixel in its memory. The researchers trained it under various conditions to see which method it adopted. If all the system had to do was reproduce a pattern, it opted for memorization; fussing with the neural network would have been overkill. But when the researchers added noise to the training process, the network came into play, since it could develop ways to resist noise. And when the researchers switched the target pattern, the network was able to learn it much more rapidly because it had developed transferable skills such as drawing lines, whereas the memorization approach had to start from scratch. In short, systems that are resilient to noise are more flexible in general. Even if disturbed, the textures created by NCAs have the ability to heal themselves. The researchers argued that their setup is a model for natural evolution. The genome does not prescribe the shape of an organism directly; instead, it specifies a mechanism that generates the shape. That enables species to adapt more quickly to new situations, since they can repurpose existing capabilities. “This can tremendously speed up an evolutionary process,” Hartl said. Ken Stanley, an artificial intelligence researcher at Lila Sciences who has studied computational and natural evolution, cautioned that NCAs, powerful though they are, are still an imperfect model for biology. Unlike machine learning, natural evolution does not work toward a specific goal. “It’s not like there was an ideal form of a fish or something which was somehow shown to evolution, and then it figured out how to encode a fish,” he noted. So the lessons from NCAs may not carry over to nature. Auto Code In regenerating lost body parts, NCAs demonstrate a kind of problem-solving capability, and Mordvintsev argues that they could be a new model for computation in general. Automata may form visual patterns, but their cell states are ultimately just numerical values processed according to an algorithm. Under the right conditions, a cellular automaton is as fully general as any other type of computer. The standard model of a computer, developed by John von Neumann in the 1940s, is a central processing unit combined with memory; it executes a series of instructions one after another. Neural networks are a second architecture that distributes computation and memory storage over thousands to billions of interconnected units operating in parallel. Cellular automata are like that, but even more radically distributed. Each cell is linked only to its neighbors, lacking the long-range connections that are found in both the von Neumann and the neural network architectures. (Mordvintsev’s neural cellular automata incorporate a smallish neural network into each cell, but cells still communicate only with their neighbors.) You are forcing it not to memorize that answer, but to learn a process to develop the solution. Stefano Nichele Long-range connections are a major power drain, so if a cellular automaton could do the job of those other systems, it would save energy. “A kind of computer that looks like an NCA instead would be a vastly more efficient kind of computer,” said Blaise Agüera y Arcas, the chief technology officer of the Technology and Society division at Google. But how do you write code for such a system? “What you really need to do is come up with [relevant] abstractions, which is what programming languages do for von Neumann–style computation,” said Melanie Mitchell of the Santa Fe Institute. “But we don’t really know how to do that for these massively distributed parallel computations.” A neural network is not programmed per se. The network acquires its function through a training process. In the 1990s Mitchell, Jim Crutchfield of the University of California, Davis, and Peter Hraber at the Santa Fe Institute showed how cellular automata could do the same. Using a genetic algorithm, they trained automata to perform a particular computational operation, the majority operation: If a majority of the cells are dead, the rest should die too, and if the majority are alive, all the dead cells should come back to life. The cells had to do this without any way to see the big picture. Each could tell how many of its neighbors were alive and how many were dead, but it couldn’t see beyond that. During training, the system spontaneously developed a new computational paradigm. Regions of dead or living cells enlarged or contracted, so that whichever predominated eventually took over the entire automaton. “They came up with a really interesting algorithm, if you want to call it an algorithm,” Mitchell said. She and her co-authors didn’t develop these ideas further, but Mordvintsev’s system has reinvigorated the programming of cellular automata. In 2020 he and his colleagues created an NCA that read handwritten digits, a classic machine learning test case. If you draw a digit within the automaton, the cells gradually change in color until they all have the same color, identifying the digit. This year, Gabriel Béna of Imperial College London and his authors, building on unpublished work by the software engineer Peter Whidden, created algorithms for matrix multiplication and other mathematical operations. “You can see by eye that it’s learned to do actual matrix multiplication,” Béna said. Stefano Nichele, a professor at Østfold University College in Norway who specializes in unconventional computer architectures, and his co-authors recently adapted NCAs to solve problems from the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus, a machine learning benchmark aimed at measuring progress toward general intelligence. These problems look like a classic IQ test. Many consist of pairs of line drawings; you have to figure out how the first drawing is transformed into the second and then apply that rule to a new example. For instance, the first might be a short diagonal line and the second a longer diagonal line, so the rule is to extend the line. Neural networks typically do horribly, because they are apt to memorize the arrangement of pixels rather than extract the rule. A cellular automaton can’t memorize because, lacking long-range connections, it can’t take in the whole image at once. In the above example, it can’t see that one line is longer than the other. The only way it can relate them is to go through a process of growing the first line to match the second. So it automatically discerns a rule, and that enables it to handle new examples. “You are forcing it not to memorize that answer, but to learn a process to develop the solution,” Nichele said. Related: AI Is Nothing Like a Brain, and That’s OK How Can AI ID a Cat? An Illustrated Guide. What Is Machine Learning? Other researchers are starting to use NCAs to program robot swarms. Robot collectives were envisioned by science fiction writers such as Stanisłav Lem in the 1960s and started to become reality in the ’90s. Josh Bongard, a robotics researcher at the University of Vermont, said NCAs could design robots that work so closely together that they cease to be a mere swarm and become a unified organism. “You imagine, like, a writhing ball of insects or bugs or cells,” he said. “They’re crawling over each other and remodeling all the time. That’s what multicellularity is really like. And it seems — I mean, it’s still early days — but it seems like that might be a good way to go for robotics.” To that end, Hartl, Levin and Andreas Zöttl, a physicist at the University of Vienna, have trained virtual robots — a string of beads in a simulated pond — to wriggle like a tadpole. “This is a super-robust architecture for letting them swim,” Hartl said. For Mordvintsev, the crossover between biology, computers and robots continues a tradition dating to the early days of computing in the 1940s, when von Neumann and other pioneers freely borrowed ideas from living things. “To these people, the relation between self-organization, life and computing was obvious,” he said. “Those things somehow diverged, and now they are being reunified.” By George Musser Contributing Writer September 10, 2025 artificial intelligence computer science games machine learning patterns All topics Share this article Facebook Copied!

[땅집고] 이달 주영엔에스가 소유권이전등기를 마친 서울 강남구 대치동 랜드마크 건물인 ‘더스톤대치’. ‘더스톤대치’는 대지면적 1214㎡, 연면적 5590.8㎡, 지하 2층~8층 규모 빌딩이다. 국내 최대 학군지인 대치동 학원가 중심지에 자리잡고 있으면서, 강남권 재건축 대장주로 꼽히는 은마아파트와 도로를 사이에 두고 마주보고 있다. 그만큼 입시학원 전문 오피스로서 입지는 최상이라는 평가다.

[땅집고] 배우 지성이 홍보하는 주영엔에스의 콘드로이친 1200 상품 광고. /주영엔에스 이렇게 총 26차례 유찰을 겪은 ‘더스톤대치’는 매수 의향을 밝혀온 주영엔에스와 약 1059억원에 수의계약을 체결했고, 이달 최종 소유권 이전까지 마칠 수 있었다. 한 빌딩업계 관계자는 “대치동에서 핵심 임차인일 수 밖에 없는 시대인재와 강남대성이 입점해있는 만큼 매수인 입장에선 1000억원 이상을 제시할 가치가 있다고 판단했을 것”이라면서도 “다만 공매로 나온 물건인데도 시세보다 크게 저렴한 가격에 매입한 사례는 아니라 다소 아쉬움이 남는 거래”라고 평가했다. 한편 2003년 설립한 주영엔에스는 건강기능식품 원료 및 제품을 개발·판매하는 회사다. 현재 지하철 8호선 문정역 인근 상가 ‘테라타워2’ 중 14개 호실을 본사 사무실로 쓰고 있다. 2022년 기준 매출액 3021억원, 영업이익 578억원을 기록했다. 고령화시대를 맞아 건강기능식품 수요가 폭발적으로 증가하면서 급성장하고 있는 회사이다. 주영엔에스 관계자는 향후 건물 활용 계획 등을 묻는 취재진에 “관련 내용에 대해서는 따로 응답드리기가 어렵다”고 전했다. /leejin0506@chosun.com Taboola 후원링크Taboola 후원링크당신이 좋아할 만한 기사ADColumbus Hous...Smart Lifestyle Trends돌아가기ADColumbus Servi...Smart Lifestyle Trends돌아가기ADNever Mix This...Health Portal돌아가기""정부 말 믿은 게 죄"" 수억 원 부동산 지각비에 통곡하는...돌아가기""정부가 구리·남양주 등 9곳 찍어줬다"" 10·15대책...돌아가기""새아파트인데,저렴한 전세 넘쳐나요"".. 천지개벽 신림...돌아가기 Taboola 후원링크Taboola 후원링크당신이 관심 있을 만한 콘텐츠ADDementia Has Been Linked...Cognitive Health News돌아가기AD56-Year-Old Replaced $2...The Skincare Magazine돌아가기ADThis Device Is Leaving Ede...FootRenew돌아가기ADMedical Myste ry Solved:...Memory Health돌아가기""참 살기 좋은데, 우린 왜 빠졌지""..호재 많...돌아가기""한 달째 27층 걸어 올라가"" 입주 1년 만...돌아가기한국인 발길 돌리자, 美 지상 낙원의 몰락…...돌아가기폭락론 시부모 설득해 30억 벌었다…""6...돌아가기 100자평0100자평 접기 로그인을 하시면 댓글 등록을 하실 수 있습니다. 건전한 토론문화를 위하여 댓글 관리 규정에 반하는 댓글은 표시가 제한됩니다.도움말삭제기준·¨"

A씨는 혈액 순환 문제라 설명하고 2019년 7월까지 약 7년간 뜸과 침 시술을 하고, 한약을 처방했다. 그 사이 B씨의 상태가 악화돼 환부 통증과 출혈이 발생했고 2018년경에는 유방 모양이 사라졌다. 지난 2019년 8월 B씨는 호흡곤란 증세로 지역 대학병원 응급실을 찾았고 유방암 4기 진단을 받았다. 당시 종양은 폐와 간, 흉막, 골까지 전이된 상태였다. 검찰은 A씨가 주의의무를 소홀히 해 B씨에게 상해를 입혔다고 보고 업무상과실치상 혐의로 기소했다. 검찰은 ""A씨는 한의사로서 유방암에 대한 전문적인 식견이 부족하고, 한의원에 (B씨 유방의) 신생물이 무엇인지 객관적으로 판별할 수 있는 검사 장비도 구비하지 않았다""면서 ""A씨는 진료 경과에 따라 환자에게 신생물 상태에 대한 추정 진단을 밝히고 다른 의료기관에서 진단받게 하는 등 환자의 건강과 생명이 위협받지 않도록 신속하게 조치해야 할 업무상 주의의무가 있다""고 했다. 그러나 A씨는 이를 '혈액순환 문제'로 판단하고 ""다른 의료기관에서 혈액·조직병리검사나 영상 진단을 받도록 권유하지 않았다""면서 ""신생물을 확인했을 때부터 (B씨가 대학병원 응급실을 내원하기 전인) 2019년 7월까지 침과 뜸 치료만 한 과실로 환자의 폐, 간, 방광뼈, 발목뼈, 등에까지 (종양이) 전이되게 했다""고 했다. A씨 측은 업무상 주의의무를 위반하지 않았다고 반박했다. 당시 ""한의사로서 허용된 의료행위만 했을 뿐""이라고 항변했다. 설령 주의의무를 위반했더라도 B씨의 상해와 상당인과관계 존재하지 않는다고 주장했다. 다만 수사기관 조사에서는 처음 촉진했을 당시 ""(B씨의 증세가) 유방암이라고 의심했다""고 진술했다. ""유방암 가능성 인지하고도 계속 침·뜸 시술"" 과실치상 유죄 지난 2021년 5월 이 사건 형사 재판을 담당한 수원지방법원 성남지원은 A씨에게 업무상과실치상죄로 금고 6개월에 집행유예 2년을 선고했다. 한의사로서 주의의무를 소홀히 했고, A씨 과실과 B씨 상해 간 상당인과관계도 있다고 봤다. 재판부는 ""비록 한방 의료행위 외에 유방초음파 촬영이나 조직검사 등을 직접 할 수 없었더라도 A씨는 한의사로서 환자의 생명과 건강에 위험이 발생하지 않도록 신속히 조치할 업무상 주의의무가 있다""고 했다. 재판부는 ""B씨는 다른 병원에서 진료를 받아보라거나 유방암인 것 같다는 이야기를 전혀 듣지 못했다. A씨는 오히려 '침과 뜸으로 치료받으면 없어지니 걱정하지 말라'고 했다. 마지막 진료에서도 '치료 다 해주고 형제들과 여행 가게 해주겠다'고만 했다. 그로부터 나흘 뒤 B씨는 대학병원 응급실에 갔고 유방암 진단을 받았다""고 지적했다. 이렇게 ""명백하게 유방암으로 의심할 만한 상태""인 환자를 7년 동안 치료하고 ""환자의 유방암 가능성을 인지하고 있으면서도"" 이를 알리거나 다른 기관 진료를 권유하지 않은 것은 한의사로서 업무상 주의의무 위반이라고 했다. 재판부는 ""A씨가 조기에 이를 알려 유방암이 발견됐다면 B씨는 암세포 전이로 인한 유방암 4기에 이르는 상해를 입지 않았을 것""이라면서 A씨에게 유죄를 선고하고 금고 6개월에 집행유예 2년을 선고했다. A씨 과실에도 불구하고 환자 역시 ""한의사만 믿고 건강검진 등 기본적인 조치를 하지 않은 과실""이 있는 점 등을 참작했다. A씨에 대한 금고형 집행유예는 양측 모두 상소하지 않으면서 확정됐다. ""한의학적 한계 있다고 한의사로서 책임까지 축소되지 않아"" 이어서 최근 열린 민사 재판에서는 A씨가 위자료 2,000만원과 지연 이자를 지급하라는 판결이 나왔다. 그 외 손해 배상 책임은 인정하지 않았다. 수원지법 성남지원 제4민사부는 A씨의 치료가 ""한의사에게 허용된 의료행위""에 들고, 환자가 제출한 증거만으로는 ""상태 호전을 위해 A씨가 그 외 해야 했을 적절한 한방 의료행위가 무엇인지 알 수 없다""고 했다. 침과 뜸 시술 그 자체로 유방암 4기라는 악결과가 발생했다고 보기 어려우므로 ""치료상 과실이라 할 이유가 없다""고 했다. 반면, 전원 의무와 설명 의무를 어겼다는 주장은 받아들였다. 민사 재판부는 ""(유방 모양이 사라진) 2018년경에는 A씨의 증상을 적절히 치료할 수 없게 됐으므로 신속히 전원 조치를 해야 할 주의의무가 발생한다""며 ""당시 A씨가 환자에게 한방 의료행위의 한계 등을 정확하게 설명했다면 환자는 유방 상태를 확실하게 진단받기 위해 다른 병원으로 전원 등을 고려해 볼 수 있었을 것""이라고 판단했다. 의사와 한의사 의료행위를 구별한 현행법상 ""한의사에게 허용된 한방 의료행위만으로 유방암 진단과 치료가 불가능하다는 A씨의 주장은 수긍가는 면이 있다""고 했다. 그러나 ""시술에도 불구하고 환자 상태가 악화됐다면 B씨에게 즉시 (의사 진료 등) 다른 방법으로 치료받을 수 있다는 점을 알리거나 전원 조치를 하는 것이 (한의사로서) 환자를 위한 최선의 조치""라고 지적했다. 한의학적 진단과 치료의 한계가 존재한다는 이유로 ""한의사의 책임 범위가 한의학상 진단·치료 가능한 범위로 축소된다고 볼 수는 없다""고 했다. ""본인 치료 경험·신념, 환자 이익에 앞세워""…위자료 일부 인정 전원 의무와 설명 의무를 지켰다면 조기에 유방암을 발견할 수 있었으리란 점은 위자료 책정에도 영향을 미쳤다. 여기 더해 재판부는 환자가 자신을 ""전적으로 의지하는 상황""인데도 A씨가 ""(한의사로서) 환자에게 이익이 되는 방향이 아니라 한의학적 암 치료에 관한 자신의 경험이나 신념을 우위에 뒀다""고 판단했다. 그러나 B씨가 유방 신생물 외 다른 증상으로 타 의료기관 진료를 받은 적이 있고 ""정확한 진단 검사로 유방 상태를 스스로 확인할 필요가 있다는 지식을 충분히 갖추고도 정년퇴직 후 유방 건강검진을 모두 회피""한 점은 불리하게 작용했다. 또한 재판부는 한의사 A씨가 환자 선택권을 적극적으로 제한하지도 않았고 ""나름 환자의 의사를 존중해 치료를 진행한 것으로 보인다""고 했다. 치료·개호비 관련 손해 배상 책임은 인정하지 않았다. A씨 과실로 유방암 진단·치료가 늦어진 것이 ""암의 진행이나 전이 속도에 어떤 영향을 미쳤는지 알 수 없다""는 이유다. 재판부는 ""환자는 기왕증이 있었고, 암의 진행이나 전이 속도는 연령과 성별, 체질 등 여러 요인으로 인해 일정하지 않다. 그러나 2012년경 환자 우측 유방에 생긴 신생물과 현재 존재하는 악성 종양 사이의 관계, 유방암이 발병한 구체적인 시기, 암의 진행이나 전이 과정에 관한 객관적인 자료가 없다""며 ""한의사의 전원 의무 위반 또는 설명 의무 불이행으로 환자가 유방암 4기에 이르는 손해가 발생했다고 인정하기 부족하다""고 판단했다. 이에 따라 법원은 B씨가 제기한 손해 배상금 총 3억7,491만4,341원 가운데 위자료 2,000만원만 인정하고 나머지 청구는 모두 기각했다. 저작권자 © 청년의사 무단전재 및 재배포 금지 좋아요4화나요80 고정민 기자 jmk02@docdocdoc.co.kr 다른기사 보기 관련기사 “68회 검사하고 암 못 찾은 한의사에 초음파 허용? 비상식적” 의협 ""한의주치의? 한의사에 '주치의' 붙이는 것부터 말 안 돼"" 공공의료사관학교로 한의사→의사 전환? 의협 “한의대 폐지하자” 말기 암 환자에게 비대면으로 한약·약수 처방? “그 자체로 위험” 대법원 간 한의협 코로나19 시스템 차단 소송…RAT 검사 판단도 '관심' 치과의사 발기부전·탈모약 ‘셀프 처방’에 法 “의료법 위반 아냐”…왜? 한의원에 환자 보냈다가 소송당한 의사…항소심 “손해배상 책임 없다” [단독] 한의사 전문약 사용 '유죄' 확정…'리도카인' 한의사 상고 취하 뇌파계로 파킨슨·치매 진단하는 한의사? 해외 학계 ‘경악’ 있는 병 놓치고 없는 병 만드는 '한의사 초음파', 위해 없다? 한의협 “의사들, 문신하려면 한의사에게 관리 교육 받아야” 뒤로멈춤앞으로 뒤로멈춤앞으로 뒤로멈춤앞으로 BEST 평소에는 의사와 동일한 의료인이라고 깝치다가 법정에만 들어가면 나는 의사가 아닌데스웅~~ 무슨 자신감으로 무슨 병인지도 모르는 환자를 7년씩이나 데리고 있었던거냐? 대학병원 가보하고 한 마디만 했어도 저 환자는 유방암 완치됐을건데.

분석의 붕괴는 채널 복잡화와 규제 변화로 인해 발생하며, 전통 분석의 핵심 가치가 사라지는 주요 원인 GA4의 인터페이스 혼란과 마이그레이션 어려움은 산업 전체에 혼란을 초래하며, 대안 도구의 부상을 촉진 이러한 변화는 운영적 고객 경험 최적화와 전략적 수익 인텔리전스라는 두 가지 새로운 경로를 제시하며, 분석이 비즈니스 결과와 직접 연결되는 미래를 예고 Part I: 디지털 분석이 실제로 무엇이었는가 디지털 분석은 데이터 기반 의사결정을 표방하며 방문자 수, 사용자 행동, 전환율을 추적하는 대시보드를 구축했으나, 대부분의 데이터가 비즈니스에 실질적인 변화를 주지 못하는 근본적 모순을 안고 있음 세부적으로는 버튼 클릭 수치가 200회로 나타나도 이를 바탕으로 어떤 행동을 취해야 할지 명확하지 않아, 흥미로운 통찰에 그치는 경우가 많음 클라이언트 프로젝트에서 정교한 분석 설정을 통해 사용자 행동을 파악해도, 실제 의사결정 변화가 미미한 패턴이 반복됨 초기 디지털 분석은 2005년 Google Analytics 출시로 웹사이트 행동을 가시화하며 혁신적 약속을 제시했으나, 실제로는 빌드-측정-학습 사이클이 복잡한 비즈니스 질문에 답하지 못함 에릭 리스(Eric Ries)의 린 스타트업 철학이 분석을 과학적 도구로 강조했으나, A/B 테스트 외에 사용자 유지나 기능 개발에 대한 명확한 지침을 제공하지 못함 Amplitude와 Mixpanel 같은 도구가 이벤트 추적과 코호트 분석을 발전시켰으나, 데이터가 풍부해질수록 통찰에서 행동으로의 격차가 더 두드러짐 디지털 분석의 실제 가치는 마케팅 속성 분석과 어두운 영역 가시화라는 두 가지에 집중되며, 나머지는 과학적 느낌을 주는 장식적 요소에 불과함 마케팅 속성 분석은 여러 채널의 기여도를 중립적으로 평가해 예산 배분을 최적화하며, ROI 계산을 가능하게 함 어두운 영역 가시화는 웹사이트 트래픽 패턴을 드러내 UX 디자이너와 마케터가 구체적인 논의를 할 수 있게 지원 The Promise That was Great at the Time but Never Delivered Google Analytics는 사용자 여정을 추적하며 데이터 기반 제품 개발을 약속했으나, 실제로 복잡한 질문에 대한 답변 부족으로 약속 미달성 상태가 지속됨 기능 출시 후 측정과 반복이 이상적이었으나, 드롭오프 원인 분석이 '왜'에 미치지 못해 행동 변화가 제한됨 대시보드와 세그먼테이션이 정교해졌음에도, 대부분의 경우 데이터가 회의 자료로만 활용되며 실질적 변화가 부족함 분석 산업은 측정이 성공 기업의 핵심이라 강조했으나, 실제로 데이터가 직관과 고객 피드백을 보완하는 수준에 그쳐 과장된 가치를 드러냄 A/B 테스트처럼 간단한 경우에는 유용하나, 유지율 향상이나 기능 우선순위 같은 핵심 문제에서 명확한 답을 주지 못함 기업들이 분석 설정에 수개월을 투자해도, '이 데이터로 무엇을 할까'라는 질문이 반복되며 불확실성을 증폭 The Two Things That Actually Worked 마케팅 속성 분석은 디지털 분석의 진정한 핵심 가치로, 여러 플랫폼의 중복 기여를 해결하며 예산 최적화와 ROI 증명을 제공 Google Analytics가 중립적 심판 역할을 하며, 캠페인별 전환 기여도를

확인되며, 포괄적 패키지가 과장된 약속으로 작용함 Part II: 기반이 무너지고 있음 마케팅 속성 분석의 붕괴는 규제 변화와 채널 복잡화로 인해 발생하며, 디지털 분석의 기반 약화를 가속화 유럽의 동의 요구와 Apple의 추적 방지가 데이터 연결을 제한하나, 이는 더 깊은 마케팅 진화의 증상 워크숍 연구에서 클릭 기반 속성의 역할이 매년 감소함을 발견하며, 기술적 대안이 근본 문제를 해결하지 못함 현대 마케팅은 수십 개 채널(인플루언서, 팟캐스트 등)을 포괄하나, 전통 속성 도구가 이를 추적하지 못해 진화 초과 상태에 있음 과거에는 Google Ads 중심이었으나, 지금은 YouTube 비디오와 뉴스레터 같은 비직접 터치포인트가 증가 광고 플랫폼의 확률적 모델(머신러닝 기반)이 세부 데이터를

제기하게 됨 Part III: 앞으로의 두 가지 경로 디지털 분석은 잔존하나, 운영적 고객 경험 최적화와 전략적 수익 인텔리전스가 새로운 방향으로 부상 마케팅 팀의 빠른 실험을 지원하며, 제품 팀과 달리 즉시 피드백을 요구 AI가 캠페인 최적화를 가속화하며, 통찰과 행동의 격차를 없애는 시스템 필요 고객 경험 최적화는 속도 중심으로, AI 에이전트가 구체적

개선을 촉진하나, 분석 깊이보다는 빠른 피드백을 우선 기업 수준에서 중소기업으로 확장되며, 문제 특화 도구의 우위를 보여줌 Path 2: Revenue Intelligence 수익 관련 역할자들이 제품 팀에서 전환하며, 수익을 사후 지표가 아닌 예측 가능하게 만드는 대상 변화를 보임 CFO와 CRO가 활성화 실패나 churn 위험을 조기 식별하며, 비즈니스 결과와 행동 연결을 요구 제품 분석의 간접 ROI와 달리, 수익 팀은 직접적 가치 계산이 가능해 예산 지원이 용이 SDK 기반 추적의 한계를 넘어 데이터 웨어하우스 접근이 돌파구를 제공하며, 데이터 품질과 결합을 보장 데이터베이스에서 이벤트를 추출해 100% 커버리지를 달성하며, 과거 데이터 재처리 가능 아이덴티티 해결과 합성 이벤트 생성으로 churn

비즈니스 성공을 직접 지원하며, 예측 중심 미래를 제시 결론 디지털 애널리틱스는 수집해 두면 언젠가 쓰일 것이라는 믿음을 기반으로 했으나, 오늘의 환경에서는 즉시적인 실행 지원이나 직접적인 성과 예측 없이는 의미가 희박해짐 데이터 수집→보고서 중심의 관행은 데이터 극장(data theater) 에 불과하며, 행동으로 이어지는 시스템이 아니면 조직적 효용이 낮음 이후의 경로 2가지 Customer Experience Optimization: 깊은 분석보다 즉각 실행을 중시하는 운영형 미래로, AI 에이전트의 구체적 개선 제안, 빠른 실험과 반영을 지원하는 워크플로 통합형 도구 지향 Revenue Intelligence: 사용자 행동과 비즈니스 성과의 직접 연결을 목표로, 데이터 웨어하우스에 행동·구독·어트리뷰션·재무 지표를 결합해 선제적 예측과 예방을 수행하는 전략형 미래 무엇이 끝나고 무엇이 시작되는가 끝나는 것: 광범위 수집과 사후적 통찰 위주의 애널리틱스, 보고서 생성을 위한 데이터 파이프라인 중심 운영, 세부 채널 기여도 집착 중심의 마케팅 해석 관행 시작되는 것: 실행 권고 자동화와 리스크·기회 조기탐지, 성과에 직결되는 모델을 중심으로 한 의사결정 자동화와 운영 최적화 과거 마케팅 애널리틱스 정서에 기대는 전략은 미래성과 정합이 낮음 조직은 보고서 생산 체제에서 행동 유발 시스템으로 전환할 필요가 있음 마케팅 팀은 속도 중심 운영형 스택과 AI 보조 실험 체계로, 매출 책임 조직은 웨어하우스 중심 통합 모델과 조기경보 시그널을 갖춘 RI 체계로 재편할 필요가 있음 수집 후 유용하길 바라는 시대는 끝났음 즉시 개선 또는 직접 예측으로 이어지는 시스템만이 실질 가치를 창출함 기업은 운영형 CX와 전략형 RI 중 핵심 과업과 성숙도에 맞는 축을 선택·강화할 필요가 있음"

A young crab-eating macaque (image: shutterstock.com). By Griffin DeanPublished: 10:46 am PST Sep 22, 2025 | Updated: 8:58 am PST Oct 3, 2025 Key Points: “Super stem cells” improve the memory of monkeys while protecting against neurodegeneration. The super stem cells prevent age-related bone loss while rejuvenating over 50% of the 61 tissues analyzed. Treatment with stem cells reduces inflammation and senescent cells (cells that accumulate to promote aging). While small in number, our adult stem cells play a crucial role in regenerating our lost or damaged tissues, rebuilding our body cell by cell. However, with age, our bodies become riddled with inflammation, hardly providing an environment capable of keeping our stem cells healthy. Eventually, our stem cells lose their regenerative capacity, contributing to degenerative aging. Fox, O, Three Hydra are a genus of immortal beings that live forever in freshwater environments like lakes and ponds. What scientists have called “nothing but an active stem cell community,” Hydra can escape death by infinitely regenerating. Their stem cells can continuously proliferate and renew by producing FoxO, a protein they share with humans. (Image: aip.org) The Immortal Hydra. In humans, the FoxO protein, specifically the FoxO3 isoform, responds to cellular stress by binding to DNA and turning genes on and off. These genes are involved in numerous cellular processes that promote healthy aging and extended lifespan. This is why the FoxO3 protein’s corresponding gene, FOXO3, is considered a longevity gene. (Morris et al., 2015) FoxO3 Promotes Health and Longevity. Experimenting with SRCs As FoxO3 assists cells in resisting stressful environments, such as inflamed tissue, Chinese Academy of Sciences researchers engineered human stem cells to have enhanced FoxO3 activity. As published in Cell, these senescence-resistant stem cells (SRCs) were designed to exhibit greater resistance to age-related stress. To test this, cynomolgus monkeys, also known as crab-eating macaques, were first stratified into four groups based on age: A1: 3-5 years (approximately equivalent to 9-15 human years) A2: 10-12 years (approximately equivalent to 30-36 human years) A3: 16-19 years (approximately equivalent to 48-57 human years) A4: 19-23 years (approximately equivalent to 57-69 human years) The oldest of the monkeys, the A4 group, were the focus of the study and were subdivided into three groups. One group was injected with saline (salt and water), another group with normal stem cells, and the third with SRCs. The aged monkeys were injected every two weeks for 44 weeks, approximately equivalent to the duration of three human years. On safety, there were no serious adverse events, such as immune system rejection or tumor growth. (Lei et al., 2025) Experimental Setup. Aged monkeys (A4) were injected with either saline (Vehicle), normal/wild-type stem cells (WTCs), or senescence-resistant stem cells (SRCs). The WTCs are human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) harboring two copies of normal/wild-type FOXO3 (FOXO3+/+), while the SRCs are edited. The genetically edited FOXO3 gene (FOXO32SA/2SA) produces a modified FoxO3 protein that stays in the nucleus of cells to increase the transcriptional activity of protective genes. SRCs Improve Cognition After 44 weeks of biweekly injections, a suite of biological indices was measured from the aged monkeys to assess whether SRCs slow down biological aging. One of these indices was memory retention. To assess memory, the researchers conducted a common experiment called the Wisconsin General Test Apparatus (WGTA). For this experiment, each monkey was trained to retrieve food located outside of one of two identical boxes. During the test session, after each monkey was trained, food was placed next to one of the boxes to keep it hidden. Subsequently, a flap was placed in front of the monkey to block the boxes from view. Three seconds later, when the flap was reopened, each monkey had to remember which of the two boxes contained the food. Remarkably, the monkeys injected with SRCs remembered the location of the food with higher accuracy than the monkeys injected with saline. Moreover, the monkeys injected with normal stem cells exhibited the same level of accuracy as the monkeys injected with saline. These findings suggest that SRCs, and not normal stem cells, improve the memory of aged monkeys. (Lei et al., 2025) SRCs Improve Memory. Left: The experimental sequence. Right: Aged monkeys (A4) injected with SRCs (green) exhibit significantly higher (*) accuracy on the WGTA than those injected with saline (black). The difference in accuracy between the saline-injected (black) and normal/wild-type stem cell-injected (blue) monkeys was not significant (ns). Furthermore, MRI-based structural analysis showed that treatment with SRCs mitigated age-related brain shrinkage. MRI-based experiments also revealed that brain connectivity was restored to that of young (A1 group) monkeys. Namely, the structural connectivity between seven brain regions, including those important for working memory (prefrontal cortex), was rejuvenated with SRC treatment. Overall, these findings suggest that SRC injections improve memory by protecting against neurodegeneration. SRCs Rejuvenate Many Organs and Tissues In addition to the brain, the Academy researchers found that SRC treatment rejuvenated multiple organs and tissues. This is important because the rejuvenation of a given organ or tissue could lead to the reduced risk of its corresponding age-related chronic diseases. For example, the rejuvenating effects of SRCs on the brain could reduce the risk of neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. One common age-related disease is osteoporosis, characterized by brittle and weak bones that make patients more prone to fractures and deadly falls. Using an X-ray imaging technique called micro-CT, the researchers found evidence for the reversal of age-related bone loss. Namely, while the aged monkeys treated with saline exhibited dental bone loss, the aged monkeys treated with SRCs had teeth more similar to those of young monkeys. (Lei et al., 2025) SRCs Improve Oral Bone Health. Compared to young monkeys (A1-Ctrl), aged monkeys (A4-Ctrl) exhibit significant bone loss. However, aged monkeys treated with wild-type stem cells (A4-WTC) show less bone loss, while aged monkeys treated with SRCs (A4-SRC) show even less bone loss. To conduct a body-wide assessment, the researchers measured the up- and down-regulation of genes from 10 systems and 61 tissues. Elevations and reductions in gene activation reflect the function (or dysfunction) of cells, tissues, and organ systems. With that said, SRC treatment was shown to rejuvenate over 50% of the tissues examined, with maximal rejuvenation achieved in areas like the hippocampus (the memory consolidation center of the brain), fallopian tubes, and colon. In contrast, the regular stem cells rejuvenated about 30% of the tissues examined. (Lei et al., 2025) SRCs Rejuvenated Multiple Tissues. Left: The 10 systems from which the 61 tissues were examined are shown. Treatment with wild-type stem cells (WTC) rescued 31.15% of genes, while SRCs rescued 54.10% of genes altered by aging. Confirming some of the rejuvenating effects inferred by the gene experiments, the researchers also observed structural changes to various organs and tissues from aged monkeys treated with SRCs. For example, the vascularity of the lung and heart was improved while the thickening of the aorta was reduced. Neurons had longer projections and fewer proteins associated with Alzheimer’s disease (e.g., beta-amyloid and phosphorylated-tau), and the kidney and brain showed less mineralization [abnormal mineral (usually calcium) deposits]. SRCs Reduce Cellular Senescence and Inflammation Modern scientists have begun to unravel the underlying causes of aging by identifying commonalities between age-related diseases at the cellular level. Two of the most prominent purported underlying causes of aging are chronic inflammation and senescent cells. With age, senescent cells accumulate throughout the body, promoting inflammation by secreting pro-inflammatory molecules. Eliminating senescent cells, which can be achieved through genetic manipulation or compounds called senolytics, ameliorates age-related diseases and even extends the lifespan of model organisms. Now, the Academy researchers demonstrate that SRCs reduce senescent cells, measured using a blue dye called SA-β-Gal, in multiple organs, including the brain, heart, and lungs. Along those lines, SRC treatment also reduced markers of inflammation and other underlying causes of aging, like DNA damage. (Lei et al., 2025) SRCs Eliminate Senescent Cells. Senescent cells are indicated by SA-β-Gal dye (light blue) and arrows. In the lung and brain, the number of senescent cells in aged monkeys treated with SRCs (green) was similar to that of young monkeys (pink). Moreover, compared to saline-treated aged monkeys (black), wild-type stem cell-treated aged monkeys (blue) exhibited less senescence in the lungs but not the brain, suggesting normal stem cells affect the lung but not the brain. Stem Cells Make Sense When it comes to combating degenerative aging, it makes sense that regenerative stem cells are a promising solution. In fact, one of the underlying causes of aging is stem cell exhaustion, whereby stem cells lose their regenerative capacity. While normal stem cells have anti-aging effects, as shown by the Chinese Academy of Sciences researchers, they are not protected against stressors like age-related inflammation. This explains why SRCs provide enhanced regenerative capacity (they withstand the harsh microenvironments induced by aging and cellular senescence). As no serious safety concerns were raised during the study, it would seem that SRCs are well tolerated. However, the long-term effects of the SRC treatment will need further evaluation. The primary concern with injecting stem cells into the bloodstream is that they can trigger the spread of cancer almost anywhere in the body. Nevertheless, the SRCs possess tumor suppression properties, suggesting they may not induce tumor growth. If this ends up being true, we may soon see SRCs being tested in humans.

TPU의 강점을 통해 미래 AI 인프라의 청사진을 그려보고자 한다. 생성형 AI 모델의 학습과 추론은 방대한 데이터를 끊임없이 이동시키고, 복잡한 수학적 연산을 수행해야 한다. 이 과정에서 기존 컴퓨팅 자원들은 메모리와 네트워크 부문에서 병목 현상을 겪기 쉽다. 특히 이더넷과 같은 범용 네트워크는 이러한 극단적인 요구를 처리하기에 역부족이다. 지기성 구글클라우드코리아 사장. (사진=구글클라우드) TPU는 AI 연산에 특화된 구조를 기반으로 고대역폭메모리(HBM)를 활용해 데이터 전송 속도와 효율을 극대화한다. 또 기존 네트워크의 오버헤드를 우회하는 전용 인터커넥트 기술을 통해 수많은 프로세서를 하나의 거대한 슈퍼컴퓨터처럼 작동시킨다. 이처럼 컴퓨팅 유닛과 네트워크를 긴밀하게 통합해 데이터 전송 지연 시간을 최소화하고, 프로세서가 유휴 상태에 놓이는 비효율을 방지한다. 이런 최적화는 단순히 속도를 높이는 것을 넘어 비용과 전력 효율성을 획기적으로 개선한다. 불필요한 전력 소모를 최소화함으로써 기업은 더 많은 작업을 수행할 수 있으며, 결과적으로 AI 모델의 개발·운영 비용을 절감하고 지속 가능한 성장 기반을 마련할 수 있다. 고도로 복잡한 AI 모델을 훈련하기 위해서는 수만 개에 이르는 컴퓨팅 유닛을 한 치의 오차 없이 동기화해야 한다. 단 하나의 칩이라도 오류가 발생하면 전체 시스템에 치명적인 영향을 줄 수 있다. 따라서 시스템 일부에 문제가 발생하더라도 제 기능을 유지하는 '내결함성'은 AI 모델 훈련에 매우 중요한 기술이다. TPU는 설계 단계부터 대규모 클러스터 환경을 염두에 두고 내결함성을 효과적으로 구현했다. 각 칩의 상태를 실시간으로 모니터링하며, 오류 발생 시 즉시 해당 부분을 예비 자원으로 대체해 작업을 빠르게 재개한다. 마치 숙련된 팀이 위기 상황에서 유연하게 역할을 조정하는 것처럼 시스템 전체의 중단 없이 작업을 이어나갈 수 있다. 또 일반적인 서버와 데이터센터 환경과는 달리, AI 컴퓨팅은 초고밀도로 집적된 시스템에서 긴밀한 협업이 필요하다. 프로세서 간 물리적 거리를 최소화하는 고밀도 시스템은 인프라의 최적 설계 방식과 전력 관리에 대한 새로운 관점을 요구한다. 단순히 개별 칩의 성능을 높이는 것을 넘어 시스템 전체의 와트당 성능을 극대화하는 방향으로 설계해야 한다. TPU는 AI 연산에 불필요한 기능을 제거해 전력 소모를 최소화하고, 효율적인 냉각 시스템과 결합돼 최적의 성능을 낸다. 이는 인프라 확장 시 전력 문제를 해결하고, 데이터센터의 운영 효율을 극대화하는 핵심 요소다. 관련기사 [기고] 인공지능과 사랑의 법적 경계2025.09.29 [기고] 국가 전산망 화재, 35년 전 경고 외면한 예고된 재앙2025.09.27 [기고] AX 시대 가속, 해법은 '오픈소스' 전략2025.09.25 AI는 광고 숨기고, 탐지 기술은 추적한다…치열한 기술 대결2025.09.25 AI 인프라의 가장 중요한 첫걸음은 보안과 정보보호 기능의 내재화다.

""대규모 오류 정정 컴퓨터 현실화""…다음 목표는 '얽힘' 물리학자 마누엘 엔드레스는 ""이는 중성 원자 양자 컴퓨팅에 있어 매우 흥미로운 순간""이라며, ""이제 우리는 대규모 오류 정정 양자 컴퓨터로 가는 길을 볼 수 있게 됐다. 기본 구성 요소는 이미 마련됐다""고 말했다. 다만, 양자 컴퓨터가 현대 슈퍼컴퓨터의 실질적인 대안이 되려면 더 많은 큐비트와 훨씬 더 높은 수준의 안정성이 요구된다. 다음 단계로, 연구진은 큐비트 간의 '얽힘(Entanglement)' 현상을 활용하는 연구를 진행할 계획이다. 이를 통해 시스템은 단순 정보 저장 수준을 넘어 실제 정보를 처리하는 수준으로 도약할 수 있을 것으로 기대된다. 물리학자 한나 마네치는 ""양자역학만이 가르쳐 줄 수 있는 방식으로 우주에 대해 배우는 데 도움이 되는 기계를 만든다는 것은 흥미로운 일""이라고 밝히며, 양자 컴퓨터를 통해 새로운 물질과 물리 법칙을 발견할 수 있을 것이라고 내다봤다. 이번 연구 결과는 세계적인 과학 저널 '네이처(Nature)'에 게재됐다. 이태준 글로벌이코노믹 기자 tjlee@g-enews.com 헤드라인 뉴스 코스피 3800시대, 반도체·대형주 집중 심화 코스피, 0.24% 상승...삼성·SK하이닉스는↓ G마켓, 3000억 쏟아 2027년 ‘플랫폼 대수술’ 다카이치 사나에, 日 최초 여성 총리 당선 中, 신규 주택 가격 11개월래 최대 낙폭 기록 삼성 무한 XR 공개...애플·메타와 'XR 삼국지' If you have a mouse, play this game for 1 minuteNavy Quest | SponsoredSponsored돌아가기함께 보면 좋은 콘텐츠Declining Memory Has Been Linke...Cognitive Health News | SponsoredSponsoredLearn More돌아가기Experts Urge Seniors With Memor...Memory Health | SponsoredSponsoredLearn More돌아가기Never Mix This Skinny Drink With...Health Portal | SponsoredSponsored돌아가기Neurologists Find Hidden Cause of...Brain Health | SponsoredSponsoredLearn More돌아가기Search for Best Medicare Supplem...Yahoo Search | Best Medicare Supplement Insurance Plan | SponsoredSponsoredLearn More돌아가기Don't Play This Game If You Are...RAID | SponsoredSponsoredPlay Now돌아가기 많이 본 기사 1 중국 스텔스 전투기 J-20 벌써 300대…한국 KF-21 보라매 2026년 실전 배치 2 테슬라, ‘옵티머스’ 부품 9460억원 규모 주문…내년 중 양산 임박 3 미국 CPI 물가 뒤늦게 발표 "" 예상밖 3.1%"" 4 엔비디아 젠슨황 방한 뉴욕증시 ""엔비디아- 삼성전자 HBM 동맹"" 5 테슬라, 삼성의 심장 화성에 R&D 거점…'생산' 넘어 '설계' 동맹으로 자세히 알아보기과학사이언스컴퓨터프로세서중앙 처리 장치금융 소프트웨어XRP 레저XRP리플암호화폐 오늘의 주요뉴스 김범수 카카오 경영쇄신위원장, SM 시세조정 혐의 1심서 '무죄' 기아, 카자흐스탄 코스타나이 공장 준공…연 7만대 생산체제 구축 中 딥로보틱스, '전천후' 휴머노이드 로봇 DR02 공개 딥시크, 시각 인식으로 텍스트 압축하는 멀티모달 AI 모델 공개 리플 XRP, 채굴 불가능-거래마다 영구 소각해 희소성 가속화 자세히 알아보기컴퓨터중앙 처리 장치과학사이언스프로세서리플XRP 레저암호화폐XRP금융 소프트웨어 투데이 컴퍼니 폭스콘, '아이폰 공장' 넘어 中 에너지 저장 시장 정조준 TSMC 초격차의 비밀...ASML 장비에 '대학의 기술력' 접목 “테슬라, AI 시대 새 성장 스토리 쓰기 시작” 애플, 아이폰17 흥행 돌풍 속 주가 사상 최고 자세히 알아보기컴퓨터과학사이언스프로세서중앙 처리 장치 리얼시승기 Previous ""블랙이 제네시스를 완성한다"", 여심 사로잡는 킹스맨 같은 차! 제네시스 G80 블랙 르노 '세닉 E-Tech 일렉트릭', 프랑스 감성 담은 패밀리 전기 SUV 매력은? 악천후에 중국산 전기차 타면 생기는 일, 'BYD 씰' 주행 리얼 시승기 ""미쳤다~! 왜 이렇게 잘 생겼니?"" 묵직하고 럭셔리한 이탈리안 정통 전기차 마세라티 그레칼레 폴고레 ""블랙이 제네시스를 완성한다"", 여심 사로잡는 킹스맨 같은 차! 제네시스 G80 블랙 르노 '세닉 E-Tech 일렉트릭', 프랑스 감성 담은 패밀리 전기 SUV 매력은? 악천후에 중국산 전기차 타면 생기는 일, 'BYD 씰' 주행 리얼 시승기 ""미쳤다~! 왜 이렇게 잘 생겼니?"" 묵직하고 럭셔리한 이탈리안 정통 전기차 마세라티 그레칼레 폴고레 ""블랙이 제네시스를 완성한다"", 여심 사로잡는 킹스맨 같은 차! 제네시스 G80 블랙 Next Original textRate this translationYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate 계속 읽어보세요[G-디펜스] 캐나다 잠수함 '12척' 수주전 격화…독일·노르웨이, TKMS '총력 지원' - 글로벌이코노믹수십억 달러 규모에 이르는 캐나다의 차세대 잠수함 사업 수주전이 뜨겁게 달아오르고 있다. 특히 독일과 노르웨이가 자국 기업인 티센크루프 마린 시스템스(TKMS)의 선정을 위해 국방장관까지 직접 나서는 총력 외교전을 펼치고 있다고 블룸버그 통신이 20일(현지시각) 보도했다.보리스 피스토리글로벌이코노믹돌아가기[속보] 다카이치 사나에, 日 최초 여성 총리 당선 - 글로벌이코노믹일본 집권 자민당 대표 다카이치 사나에가 21일 의회 의원들에 의해 일본 제104대 총리로 선출되어 일본 최초의 여성 총리가 됐다고 21일(현지시각) 닛케이 아시아가 보도했다.다카이치는 임시 회기를 위해 소집된 후 하원에서 과반수 득표를 확보했다. 퇴임하는 이시바 시게루 총리와 그의 내글로벌이코노믹돌아가기[실리콘 디코드] 삼성전자, '4나노 승부수' 통했다…HBM4 로직 다이 수율 90% 돌파 - 글로벌이코노믹삼성전자가 차세대 인공지능(AI)용 고대역폭 메모리(HBM) 시장 주도권을 되찾기 위해 개발 중인 HBM4의 로직 다이(logic die)가 사실상 양산 안정 단계에 진입했다.20일(현지시각) IT전문 매체 새미그루와 업계 보고에 따르면, 삼성이 야심 차게 준비 중인 HBM4의 4나노(글로벌이코노믹돌아가기[특징주] 휴림로봇, 정부 로봇 산업 지원 강화에 사흘째 '불기둥' - 글로벌이코노믹휴림로봇의 주가가 사흘동안 강세를 보이고 있다. 정부의 로봇 산업에 대한 정부의 정책 지원 예고와 규제 완화 기대감이 맞물리면서 투심을 자극한 것으로 보인다. 21일 한국거래소에 따르면 휴림로봇은 오전 09시40분 전 거래일 대비 8.53% 오른 6490원에 거래중이다. 전날에는 전장글로벌이코노믹돌아가기 ' ' ' ' ' ' KB자산운용, ‘RISE ETF’ 2종 출시...ETF 순자산총액 20조 돌파 '앞장' - 글로벌이코노믹KB자산운용이 2종의 ETF를 새롭게 출시하며 19조원대 후반에서 주춤하던 'RISE ETF' 순자산총액을 20조원 대로 끌어 올릴 것으로 보인다.

Aster-A는 세포막에서 세포 내로 콜레스테롤을 운반하면서 세포막 성분의 균형이 유지되도록 돕는다. 연구팀은 T세포에서 Aster-A를 없앤 생쥐를 만들어 관찰한 결과 T세포가 과도하게 활성화돼 ‘Th17 세포’라는 염증을 일으키는 면역세포가 늘어났다. Th17 세포는 ‘IL-22’ 단백질을 만들어 장에서 지방 흡수를 줄이는 작용을 했다. 그 결과 생쥐들은 기름진 먹이를 먹어도 비만에 잘 걸리지 않았다. 반대로 연구팀이 장 속 미생물을 없애거나 IL-22의 작용을 차단하자 줄어들었던 지방 흡수 능력이 다시 정상으로 돌아왔다. 연구팀은 ""면역계와 대사 시스템이 서로 영향을 주고받는다는 새로운 사실을 입증했다""며 “T세포의 기능이 비만이나 대사 질환의 예방과 치료에 중요한 실마리가 될 수 있다”고 말했다.

QR이 코 속 신경세포에서만 발현돼 실험실에서는 작동하지 않았기 때문이다. 그동안 과학자들은 어떤 수용체가 어떤 냄새 분자에 반응하는지를 확인하기 위해 쥐 같은 설치류를 대상으로 한 대규모 실험에 의존했다. 실험을 반복할 때마다 동물을 희생해야 해 윤리적·기술적 부담이 컸다. 많은 QR이 어떤 냄새 분자와 결합하는지 밝혀지지 않은 이른바 ‘고아 수용체(orphan receptor)’로 남아 있던 이유다. 지보단 연구팀은 ‘헤크293(HEK293)’이라는 인간 세포주를 변형시켜 세포에서 QR 단백질이 잘 만들어지고 작동하도록 했다. HEK293은 사람의 배아 콩팥 세포에서 유래한 실험용 세포다. 연구팀은 QR 구조의 끝부분(C-말단)을 조작해 HEK293이 QR을 안정적으로 표면에 붙여 발현시키고 훨씬 더 잘 만들도록 설계했다. 약 400가지 OR 단백질을 실험실에서 HEK293 세포를 통해 발현시켰다. 실험실 안에서 냄새를 맡는 세포 모델을 만든 것이다. 연구팀은 실험 결과 각 QR이 특정 냄새 분자에만 반응했다고 말했다. 그동안 여러 QR이 조합돼 함께 냄새를 인식한다는 가설이 주류였지만 단일 QR이 특정 향을 담당할 수 있다는 반론이다. 예를 들어 고아 수용체로 분류된 QR 중 하나는 향유고래의 장에서 유래하는 대표적인 향수 성분인 '용연향'의 핵심 분자를 ​​감지했다. 또 다른 QR은 조향사들이 나무 냄새라고 부르는 향에 의해 활성화됐다. 특정 QR은 박하와 비슷한 향이 나는 '파출리'향을 감지한다. 연구결과는 실험실에서도 사람의 후각 수용체가 냄새에 어떻게 반응하는지 직접 관찰할 수 있게 한다. 향료 회사나 식품 회사가 ‘특정 냄새를 내는 분자’를 더 정확히 찾을 수 있게 해준다.

[사진=본인 제공] “주식투자 성공 비결이요? S&P500을 사고 한동안 잊고 사는 방법을 추천합니다.”수학과 데이터, 숫자로만 승부하는 세계 금융투자 대회에서 첫 한국인 챔피언이 탄생했다. 농구를 좋아하는 스물 다섯 살 평범한 공대생, 김민겸 씨는 투자 고수 중에서도 진짜 선수들만 살아남는다는 ‘퀀트 투자’에서 우승을 차지했다.UNIST 산업공학과에 재학 중인 김 씨는 “퀀트 투자는 천재들의 분야라는 인식이 있는데, 평범한 내가 우승해 멋쩍다”고 말했다. 김 씨가 우승한 대회는 미국 글로벌 자산운용사 ‘월드퀀트’가 주최한 제5회 국제 퀀트 챔피언십이다. 142개국 8만여 명이 참가했는데 김 씨는 콜럼비아대, 인도공과대, 옥스퍼드대 등 세계 명문대 학생들을 모두 제쳤다. 놀라운 것은 김 씨가 퀀트 투자를 공부한 지 갓 반 년이 지난 초보라는 점이다. 그는 “퀀트 투자는 올해 3월 대회에 참가하면서 시작했다. 저는 주식에 관심있는 평범한 학생일 뿐”이라며 웃었다.퀀트 투자는 정량화된 데이터를 가지고 전략과 알고리즘을 만들어 투자하는 방법이다. 막연한 감이나 인맥으로 얻은 정보로 투자하는 게 아니라, 오직 숫자로만 승부한다.주가의 변동, 기업의 재무제표에 적힌 숫자들로 무엇을 언제 사고 팔 지 결정하는 알고리즘을 만드는 게 핵심이다. 알고리즘을 만든 다음에는 사람이 개입할 여지는 없다.첫 주식 투자는 여느 대학생처럼 평범했다. 김 씨는 4년 전 군대에 있을 때 모은 용돈으로 조금씩 투자를 하기 시작했다. 처음에는 초심자의 행운이 있었다. 훈련 받느라 잊고 있었던 주식들이 모두 30~40%가 올랐다.김 씨는 “두자릿수 수익에 들떠서 많이 팔았는데 나중에 땅을 치고 후회했다. 지금 기준으로 800% 가까이 오른 엔비디아도 있었다”고 말했다. 학구열이 불타올랐다. 체계적으로 주식을 공부해야겠다고 결심했다. 수익 여부를 떠나 확실한 근거를 갖고 투자하고 싶었다. 스포츠 과학처럼 숫자로 분석하는 걸 좋아했던 그는 주식시장도 숫자로 분석할 수 있을 거라고 믿었다. 각종 자료를 찾아보기 시작했고, 복학 이후에는 학교에서 열리는 ‘알고리즘 트레이딩’ 수업도 들었다.그가 참가한 국제퀀트 챔피언십은 참가자들이 퀀트 알고리즘으로 만든 포트폴리오의 수익률, 샤프 지수, 거래량 회전율을 평가한다. 김 씨의 알고리즘은 미국 주식 시장에서 15.39% 수익률을 냈다. 높은 수익률이긴 하지만, 참가자 중 김 씨보다 높은 수익률을 낸 사람은 더 많았다.우승 비결은 거시경제를 보는 안목이었다. 다른 참가자들은 알고리즘과 수학 모델의 완성도에 집중하는 반면, 김 씨는 기준금리 변동처럼 거시경제의 움직임을 분석했다. 저금리 상황에 필요한 전략과 고금리 상황에 필요한 전략을 따로 세우고 조합했다. 심사위원들은 김 씨의 알고리즘이 더 투자 현실에 적합한 모델이라고 평가했다.숫자를 중시하는 퀀트 투자이지만, 어떤 데이터를 보고 전략을 세우는 데는 직관이 필요하다. 퀀트를 공부하면서 생긴 직관은 김 씨의 개인 투자에도 도움이 됐다. 김 씨의 개인 투자 수익률은 연평균 30%다.비결을 묻는 질문에 김 씨는 “유튜브를 보면 개별 종목에만 너무 집중하는 사람들이 많은데, 거시 경제가 돌아가는 걸 보는 게 더 중요하다”고 했다. 평범한 투자자들에게 S&P500 적립 투자를 권하는 이유다.그의 목표는 한국에 퀀트 투자를 널리 알리는 것이다. 김 씨는 “제가 공부할 때 국내 자료가 없어 해외 자료를 뒤져야 했다. 조만간 퀀트 투자를 소개하는 SNS 페이지도 개설할 예정”이라고 말했다. 그는 “국장(한국 주식 시장)은 비합리적이라 퀀트 투자가 안 될 거라는 의견이 많은데, 그런 고정관념을 깨고 싶다”는 포부도 밝혔다. 이 기사가 마음에 들었다면, 좋아요 4 댓글 2 나의 댓글 댓글정책 공감순 최신순 오래된순 ruri**** 2025.10.16 12:47 신고 그리고 몇년 후 국장에 뎀볐다가 반토막 난 그는 제가 국장을 너무 우습게봐서 이꼴났습니다고 사과하게 되는데 답글 0 0 0 onso**** 2025.10.15 00:59 신고 ㅂ신 ㄱ소리하고 자빠졌네 답글 0 0 13 인기뉴스 2025-10-21 16:59 기준 1 통역하러 캄보디아 간 한국인 여성…감금돼 강제 성인방송 노동 1시간 전 2 “10년·8만원 부으면 60세부터 월 21만원 탄다”…전국 최초 연금 어디길래 2025.10.19 20:15 3 “돈 요구 한 번, 일 커질 줄 몰랐다” 이이경 사생활 루머 폭로자, 입장 보니 10시간 전 4 “방송 끝나면 전화 300통”…보증 때문에 ‘80억 빚’ 신동엽, 심경고백 방금 전 5 “22억에 샀어야 했나”…1년새 급등한 마포 국평, 30억 육박 방금 전 Taboola 후원링크Taboola 후원링크당신이 관심 있을 만한 콘텐츠ADDon't Play This Game If You Are Under 30RAID | Play Now돌아가기ADThree Columbus Banks Are Paying Record High Interest Rates - See the ListSavingsPro | 돌아가기“졸음운전 뺑소니에 사망”…39세 여배우 소속사 “믿기지 않는다”매일경제돌아가기“구치소 다녀온 후 달라져”…서동주, ‘캄보디아 사망’ 고 서세원 회상매일경제돌아가기 Taboola 후원링크Taboola 후원링크지금 뜨고 있는 콘텐츠ADNew Small SUV Clearance Sale - Prices May Surprise You!FrequentSearches | Search Ads | Learn More돌아가기ADDementia Has Been Linked To a Common Habit.
