2,,https://www.wsj.com/business/ballmer-clippers-leonard-sanberg-aspiration-49924b19?mod=hp_lead_pos7,text,"Los Angeles entrepreneur and progressive activist Joe Sanberg was in trouble.

His online bank, Aspiration, had attracted buzz and A-list investors like Robert Downey Jr. and Leonardo DiCaprio with its eco-friendly pitch, but by 2022 it was running out of money. Sanberg had begun falsifying financial documents and concocting phony customers in a scheme he would later admit defrauded investors of more than $248 million.

His dream of springboarding into politics with an antipoverty message was fizzling, too. A $10-million campaign to raise California¡¯s minimum wage, part of a plan to propel him to the governor¡¯s mansion or maybe even the White House, was heading for defeat.

As the pressure mounted, though, Sanberg fixated on closing a deal that bewildered some colleagues: A $48-million endorsement contract between his struggling bank and Kawhi Leonard, an NBA star considered one of the less charismatic members of L.A.¡¯s less glamorous franchise, the Clippers.

¡°Makes no business sense whatsoever,¡± a senior Aspiration executive texted Mike Shuckerow, the company¡¯s general counsel and chief operating officer, after learning of the proposed deal with Leonard, who was riding the bench that season while recovering from an ACL injury.

Sanberg pushed through the deal anyway. Now that contract is at the center of one of the biggest financial controversies in recent sports history. Leonard performed no significant work for the endorsement money, and the NBA has commissioned an investigation into whether the Clippers¡¯ billionaire owner, Steve Ballmer, a former Microsoft CEO and a prized Aspiration investor, used the company to evade league salary-cap rules and pay Leonard through another channel.

The Clippers have denied breaking any rules. Several former senior executives of the bank said in interviews they never heard such a plan discussed. ¡°The notion that Steve invested in Aspiration in order to funnel money to Kawhi Leonard is absurd,¡± the team said in a written statement.

In the basketball world, the controversy has centered on the potential involvement of Ballmer, long seen as a model owner.

After getting his start in venture capital, Sanberg started an eco-conscious bank and aimed to fight poverty. He spoke to students in Compton, Calif., in 2017. Patrick Fallon/ZUMA Press
On Monday, Sanberg is scheduled to appear in a federal courtroom in L.A. to plead guilty to wire fraud in what prosecutors describe as a scheme that defrauded hundreds of Aspiration investors. Two days later, Ballmer¡¯s team will take the basketball court in Salt Lake City to open their 2025 season.

Sanberg hasn¡¯t publicly explained his actions, and his lawyer, Marc Mukasey, declined an interview request on his behalf. ¡°There is a lot of misinformation out there about Joe Sanberg,¡± said Mukasey, adding that a future legal filing would provide ¡°a full picture of who he is.¡±

Star investors
Sanberg co-founded Aspiration in 2013. The bank billed itself as the ¡°financial firm with a conscience.¡± It offered traditional services like other retail banks. It also offered fossil fuel-free investments, donated 10% of earnings to charity and let customers round up to the next dollar on bank-card transactions to fund tree planting.

That pitch attracted a host of celebrity investors?DiCaprio, Downey, Orlando Bloom, Cindy Crawford, Kaia Gerber and the musician Drake. Sanberg wasn¡¯t an Aspiration employee, but he served on its board and acted as a rainmaker. In meetings with prospective investors, Sanberg ticked off the names of his Hollywood investors.

Ballmer may have been the most important name of all. In 2021, he invested $50 million in the company. Weeks later, Sanberg announced a partnership that made the Clippers one of the most important customers of a new carbon-credit business launched by the bank. The Clippers planned to put an Aspiration patch on its jerseys, and there were discussions about putting the bank¡¯s name on a new arena. 

¡°There are few people in the business world and in the sports world that I admire as much as Steve Ballmer,¡± Sanberg said at the September 2021 announcement at the Clippers¡¯ arena, as Ballmer looked on.

Aspiration seemed to be on a roll. A plan to take it public would have valued the company at $2.3 billion, and put Sanberg, its largest shareholder, on track to become a rare type of billionaire?a bleeding-heart liberal who listed his occupation as ¡°anti-poverty advocate.¡±

But things weren¡¯t what they seemed. In a plea agreement Sanberg struck this August with federal prosecutors, he admitted that starting in 2020, his efforts to support the company turned fraudulent.

He borrowed $145 million to aid the company using his own stock as collateral and furnished fraudulent financial statements to lenders to guarantee the transaction, the plea agreement said. Federal prosecutors haven¡¯t accused Aspiration employees of involvement in the fraud.

Sanberg also recruited friends and associates to present themselves as potential customers for the carbon-credit business. Pledges they submitted to unwitting company officials gave a false impression of ¡°explosive growth,¡± allowing him to raise more than $300 million from misled investors, according to a separate Securities and Exchange Commission complaint against Sanberg.

The SEC complaint indicates that most of the bank¡¯s $216 million revenue in 2022 was unconnected to the fraud. Sanberg¡¯s associates said in interviews that they believed he was trying to keep Aspiration solvent until a public offering or other infusion of funds. 

In the basketball world, Ballmer is celebrated for rescuing the Clippers from the messy end to the previous ownership regime, and for pouring his wealth into the roster and a new arena. He had an interest in fighting climate change and wanted the new facility to be carbon-neutral. 

His $50 million investment in Aspiration was like a rounding error for the man whose net worth Forbes calculates at $155 billion, but it gave Sanberg an invaluable boost.

Jay Rogers, the CEO of a family office contemplating a business partnership with Aspiration, recalled sitting up at the mention of Ballmer¡¯s name. ¡°It was like, ¡®OK, this is real,¡¯¡± Rogers said.

He told one political associate that Ballmer had told him that he reminded the billionaire of a younger version of himself. The associate recalled Sanberg saying that he and Ballmer were becoming friends.

A person close to the Ballmer Group, his investment company, said the two hardly knew each other. He said that Ballmer and Sanberg had their first significant interaction at the press conference announcing the partnership between the Clippers and Aspiration.

Success story
Sanberg grew up in Villa Park, an inland neighborhood of Orange County far from the mansions of Newport Beach. His single mom struggled to make ends meet and eventually lost the family home to foreclosure.

A stellar student, Sanberg graduated from Harvard and then went into finance. After a stint at Blackstone, he hit it big as a founding investor in the meal-kit company Blue Apron. 

Sanberg never passed up an opportunity to tell others about growing up, as he once said on MSNBC, in a ¡°in a paycheck-to-paycheck household.¡± In investor pitches and interviews, he said the desire to help people like his mother led him to co-found an environmental bank and get involved in politics.

Facebook posts show him delivering tarps and food to homeless people and protesting after the death of George Floyd. At events sponsored by his charity, he spoke easily with poor mothers and children. 

Even as he talked about the plight of the working class, he often failed to pay people who worked for him, according to several advisers who said they are owed money. A communications consultant, a single mother of three, said she chased him unsuccessfully for months to collect fees.

By 2020, Sanberg was flirting with a long-shot presidential run, explaining to a reporter during an exploratory trip to Iowa, ¡°I would uniquely talk about poverty.¡±

When Bernie Sanders dropped out of the 2020 presidential race, Sanberg snapped up at least four of his advisers as personal political consultants. He and his advisers pursued a 2022 ballot measure to raise California¡¯s minimum wage to $18 an hour. He threw in $10 million, not including the cost of consultants, but failed to meet the deadline to get the issue on the ballot.

Unusual deal
In December 2021, Sanberg told a high-ranking Aspiration executive that the Clippers had approached him about doing a deal with Leonard, their injured star. The executive recalled Sanberg saying: ¡°This is important to the Clippers.¡± 

Aspiration executives learned that Sanberg was advocating for a four-year, $48 million deal with Leonard. Sanberg didn¡¯t control such agreements, but as the largest stockholder and a board member, his preferences carried weight.

Inside the company, jaws dropped at the terms, with one executive telling a colleague that Aspiration could purchase seven Super Bowl ads for the contract price. 

¡°If you want a talent deal¡¦maybe we should shop around. Do some research. Consider a different team,¡± one top executive told Shuckerow, the general counsel, in a text message reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. ¡°You can¡¯t just commit to a $48M spend without talking to people in the company. I don¡¯t get it.¡±

¡°Totally agree,¡± Shuckerow responded. ¡°Kawhi is a regional star. He doesn¡¯t have the charisma of a Steph Curry, Lebron etc.¡±

Leonard was unflashy on the court and tight-lipped off of it. Charles Barkley once called him a ¡°cyborg.¡± 

The deal Sanberg brought the company called for Leonard to receive $20 million in Aspiration stock on top of $28 million in cash, but the company balked at handing over that much equity. In one email to company executives, reviewed by the Journal, Sanberg said then CEO Andrei Cherny ¡°judged the deal not to be worth doing.¡± 

Sanberg then agreed to give Leonard shares from his own holdings, telling executives in an email that they would come to see their error: ¡°The benefits that you¡¦will get from this partnership are subsidized by MY $20 million of stock.¡±

The 19-page contract required autograph signings, meet-and-greets, community-service events and an annual eight-hour day of filming, among other things.

A marketing director reviewing the terms complained in an email to supervisors about ¡°some pretty big flags,¡± including that the man they were paying to introduce the public to their company didn¡¯t use social media. ¡°We should be getting way more than one 8-hr. production day for the price that we are paying,¡± she said.

Company officials considered various strategies for how Leonard might contribute, including a web series in which he tried to reduce his carbon footprint. The marketing department mocked up a Leonard bobblehead with an Aspiration logo.

None of it came to pass, and Leonard was never announced as a spokesman. By the time of the second payment to Leonard, the bank¡¯s financial woes were mounting. The company canceled a long planned ad blitz and stopped paying bills large and small, according to lawsuits filed against the bank.

Former top executives at Aspiration said that although people inside Aspiration had concerns about the deal, there had never been any discussion or speculation by senior executives that it might be a vehicle for Leonard and the Clippers to circumvent the salary cap. 

In the NBA, the cap sets maximums for both teamwide and individual spending on players. It aims to prevent the wealthiest owners from gobbling up all available superstars. NBA commissioner Adam Silver has called cap circumvention ¡°a cardinal sin.¡±

Speculation in the basketball world that the Aspiration deal was a cap workaround flourished partly because of previous allegations involving Leonard. In 2019, when Leonard first signed with the Clippers, the NBA looked into whether the team gave him or his representatives anything beyond a standard player contract. The league found no proof of that.

By late 2022, with Leonard seven months into his endorsement contract, Aspiration was strapped for cash but still expressing optimism to potential investors.

A new chief executive was brought on to pivot the company¡¯s focus from consumer bank to a leaner carbon-credit business aimed at corporations. Sanberg told potential investors he planned to put $50 million of his own money into the company to support that change, which would include slashing the workforce, according to records reviewed by the Journal. That CEO met with Ballmer in November 2022, according to two people with knowledge of the meeting.

The next month, Dennis Wong?a minority Clippers owner whose daughter worked for Aspiration?invested $2 million. In March 2023, Ballmer put in $10 million. A person familiar with the investment said Ballmer intended it as a show of support and confidence for the new CEO.

One of the most influential sports journalists in the country would see it differently. 

Pablo Torre began the Sept. 3 episode of his hit podcast ¡°Pablo Torre Finds Out¡± with a bombshell. He laid out evidence suggesting Ballmer had violated the salary cap by using Aspiration to funnel money to Leonard.

A person Torre identified as an employee of Aspiration¡¯s finance department, his face and voice obscured, recalled being told of the Leonard deal: ¡°It was to circumvent the salary cap. LOL.¡±

The Clippers denied that, but the podcast and a series of follow-up reports went viral. Ballmer told ESPN, in reference to Aspiration: ¡°I made an investment in these guys, thinking it was on the up and up, and they conned me. At this stage, I have no ability to predict why they might have done anything they did, let alone the specific contract with Kawhi.¡± The NBA hired the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz to investigate the matter.

Sanberg¡¯s world, by that point, had come crashing down. In February 2025, he was charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud. His 80-year-old mother signed a $200,000 bond to secure his release on bail.

Aspiration, by then doing business as CTN Holdings, filed for bankruptcy a month later, listing debts of between $100 million and $500 million. The Aspirations stock that Drake, Downey Jr., and some 250 other investors held was almost certainly worthless. 

Sanberg told a federal judge in L.A. last month that he wanted to plead guilty. Under a plea deal, he would admit two counts of wire fraud in exchange for prosecutors seeking no more than 19¨ö years in prison.

In February, Ballmer and the Clippers will be hosting the NBA¡¯s All-Star festivities. If Sanberg is watching, it won¡¯t be from his old courtside seat."

Jensen Huang was wrapping up a trip celebrating the Lunar New Year in Asia this past January when Masayoshi Son, the chief executive of SoftBank, stood alongside Sam Altman at the White House to unveil what was billed as the largest AI infrastructure project in history. 

For almost a decade, the Nvidia NVDA -0.32%decrease; red down pointing triangle chief executive had supplied the AI chips that powered OpenAI¡¯s rise. Huang wanted to be the one unveiling such a giant deal with OpenAI¡¯s CEO, according to people familiar with his thinking. 

Soon after, Nvidia secretly pitched OpenAI on a similar project, offering to effectively sideline SoftBank and help raise the funds needed to build new data centers itself. The talks culminated in a giant $100-billion deal between the two companies, announced at Nvidia¡¯s Santa Clara headquarters last month. 

¡°This is the largest computing project in history,¡± Huang said. 

Altman might not have intended to give Huang FOMO, or the fear of missing out, but he had that effect. And it is getting contagious. 

To achieve his vision of securing seemingly endless computing power for OpenAI, Altman has gone on a dealmaking blitz, playing the egos of Silicon Valley¡¯s giants off one another as they race to cash in on OpenAI¡¯s future growth.

The resulting game of financial one-upmanship has tied the fates of the world¡¯s biggest semiconductor and cloud companies?and vast swaths of the U.S. economy?to OpenAI, essentially making it too big to fail. All of them are now betting on the success of a startup that is nowhere near turning a profit and facing a mounting list of business challenges.

Investors aren¡¯t bothered.

On four separate days over the past two months, the stock prices of Oracle, Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Broadcom soared after they disclosed OpenAI-related deals?adding a combined $630 billion to their market value in the first day of trading after the announcements. A broader rally in tech stocks followed each time, helping lift the U.S. stock market to record highs.

¡°The most successful people I know believe in themselves almost to the point of delusion,¡± Altman once wrote in a 2019 blog post titled ¡°How To Be Successful,¡± before adding: ¡°Self-belief alone is not sufficient?you also have to be able to convince other people of what you believe.¡±

Ever since the viral launch of ChatGPT, Altman has pumped up AI¡¯s world-changing potential more than any other tech CEO, prophesying a world where the technology finds a cure to cancer, provides customized tutoring to every student on earth, and becomes an endless gusher of profits for the companies behind it. 

He wants OpenAI to be at the center of this transformation, and recently told employees that the company¡¯s long-term goal was to build 250 gigawatts worth of computing capacity by 2033 in order to make it happen. Such a plan would cost more than $10 trillion by today¡¯s standards and be enough to power a mid-sized country like Germany.

OpenAI is set to generate $13 billion in revenue this year?a tiny fraction of the $650 billion in computing bills that it is signing up for between its Nvidia and Oracle deals alone, according to calculations made by The Wall Street Journal. The cost could be closer to the trillion-dollar mark when factoring in agreements with AMD, Broadcom, and other cloud providers like Microsoft.

The commitments to build such massive amounts of chips and data centers before OpenAI can afford it are fueling fears that enthusiasm for AI is turning into a bubble hinging on the success of just one company?and increasingly the vision of one person. Some of Altman¡¯s partners are even helping OpenAI pay for their chips, creating circular deals that prop up demand.

Altman says that OpenAI is dealing with computing shortages so severe that it is having to delay product releases as a result. He believes that revenue will grow with more computing power. This month, OpenAI¡¯s new Sora video app rocketed to the top of the App Store, showing that the company¡¯s penchant for building viral products goes beyond ChatGPT.

¡°I have learned over my career, again and again and again, you just have to trust the exponential,¡± Altman said at an event in Tokyo earlier this year. ¡°We¡¯re not built to conceptualize it, but you just have to trust.¡±

Breakfast at ¡®Versailles¡¯
The 40-year-old AI pioneer has never been afraid to bet big. He dropped out of Stanford University to start his first company, at one point using his poker winnings to fund college expenses. After becoming rich, Altman put large chunks of his wealth in startups chasing far-flung technologies like cryptocurrency and nuclear fusion, and loaded up on debt to increase the size of his investments, convinced of their unlimited upside.

Other CEOs were not always on board with his AI ambitions.

Last year, Altman asked Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella if his company would invest at least $100 billion building new data centers for OpenAI, calling the project Stargate. He said no. 

He got the same response when pitching leaders at the Taiwanese chip-making giant TSMC on a $7-trillion project building new chip manufacturing plants across the world. Altman is ¡°too aggressive for me to believe,¡± chief executive C.C. Wei said at the company¡¯s annual shareholder meeting in 2024.

Altman then turned to Son, the risk-taking chief executive of SoftBank, who was looking to go big in AI after a series of bungled startup bets, including a failed $16-billion investment in WeWork. 

Son had grown obsessed with the singularity, the hypothetical moment where AI becomes smarter than humans and transforms civilization, and was dreaming up ideas such as building AI-powered robot factories across the world. When Altman met Son for dinner in 2023, he emphasized that none of this would be possible without a lot more computing power.

¡°I started thinking, well, if more is better, we should do a lot,¡± Son recounted at a Tokyo event with Altman. 

Hoping to strike a deal, Son invited Altman last November to stay for several days as a guest in his home near Tokyo, a sprawling, countryside estate lined with statues of Roman emperors that associates call Versailles for its striking resemblance to the former royal residence of the French King Louis XIV. (One entrance features a black-and-gold iron gate with a crest featuring an ¡°M¡± with a crown on top). 

Over plates of scrambled eggs, Altman laid out his vision for building a new cloud company with SoftBank that would finance and build data centers across the U.S. for OpenAI. Son agreed to lead what they later unveiled as a planned $500 billion effort, also called Stargate. 

The joint venture recently hit some snags after the two sides disagreed over which sites to build on, The Wall Street Journal reported. OpenAI and SoftBank announced two new data-center sites last month, but they are a fraction of the capacity that OpenAI is securing elsewhere.

But Altman¡¯s wooing of Son succeeded in kicking off an investment mania. SoftBank¡¯s stock shot up 11% after the White House announcement, as did those of other tech partners named on the project. In the coming weeks and months, OpenAI received hundreds of proposals for potential sites to build on, setting the stage for its next act.

Microsoft cedes ground
In January, Microsoft¡¯s Nadella was attending an unseasonably warm edition of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland when he was asked in a TV interview about the $500-billion Stargate announcement.

¡°Look, all I know is, I¡¯m good for my $80 billion,¡± he said with a chuckle, referencing how much Microsoft said it would spend building data centers for the fiscal year. The sentiment echoed those shared by two of Altman¡¯s biggest rivals, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and Elon Musk, both of whom cast doubt on the project. 

For years, Microsoft¡¯s stock had boomed thanks to its six-year partnership with OpenAI, which included its lucrative role as the startup¡¯s exclusive cloud provider. But some executives inside its Redmond, Wash., headquarters were growing hesitant about funding the massive data-center build-out that Altman wanted, which seemed to increase with no end in sight. 

In February, Nadella was asked in a podcast interview why he wasn¡¯t investing $800 billion into data centers as opposed to $80 billion, given AI¡¯s potential.

¡°At some point, the supply and demand have to map,¡± he responded. ¡°You can go off the rails completely when you are hyping yourself with the supply-side, versus really understanding how to translate that into real value to customers.¡±

Two days later, analysts at the brokerage firm TD Cowen published a report stating that Microsoft had canceled some of its data-center leases in the U.S., citing its move away from supporting OpenAI workloads. It sparked fresh debate about whether spending on AI infrastructure had grown too extreme. 

Microsoft gave OpenAI permission to find additional computing capacity from other cloud providers, and focused its efforts on courting other customers.

Then, Oracle swooped in to sign its own $300-billion contract with the startup. Its stock shot up by almost 40% after disclosing a massive uptick in future revenue thanks to the deal, putting it within striking distance of a $1-trillion valuation and briefly making its chairman Larry Ellison the world¡¯s richest man. 

It was a giant win for the 48-year-old legacy database provider, which had long struggled to establish itself in the cloud computing industry. Some Microsoft leaders privately criticized the deal, arguing that it wasn¡¯t certain that Oracle would be able to pull it off. (The giant data-center build-out puts OpenAI on the hook for an average of $60 billion in yearly payments, more than 4 times its current revenue). 

A week after Oracle¡¯s stock spike, Nadella announced what he called ¡°the world¡¯s most powerful AI data center,¡± located in Wisconsin, that will be used in part to train OpenAI models, sharing a video online that showed how quickly Microsoft built the site.

Microsoft is now discussing providing additional computing capacity to OpenAI, according to people familiar with the matter.

A mysterious report
By the summer, the talks between OpenAI and Nvidia on their own AI infrastructure project had stalled.

Then, on June 27, the tech site The Information published a report stating that OpenAI had begun renting Google¡¯s TPU chips to power ChatGPT, causing something of a stir inside Nvidia¡¯s Santa Clara headquarters. 

At the time, it was well-known that OpenAI was looking for ways to reduce its reliance on Nvidia. The startup was busy designing its own custom chip with Broadcom, and was also taking a close look at the chips offered by Nvidia rival AMD. 

That spring, OpenAI also signed its first cloud contract with Google, raising the specter that it might begin using its chips as well.

After the story was published, Huang called Altman asking him if it was true, and signaled that he was open to getting the talks back on track, according to people familiar with the matter. Huang realized that Nvidia could help OpenAI by making a direct investment in the company, a person who spoke to him said. 

Nvidia¡¯s X account then posted a screenshot of an article wherein OpenAI denied having plans to use Google¡¯s in-house chip.

Nvidia ended up signing an agreement to lease up to 5 million of its chips to OpenAI, costing $350 billion by today¡¯s standards. It also has the right to invest up to $100 billion to help the startup pay for the deal.

As part of the deal, Nvidia is also discussing guaranteeing some of the loans that OpenAI plans to take out to build its own data centers, people familiar with the matter said?a move that could saddle the chip giant with billions of dollars in debt obligations if the startup can¡¯t pay for them. The arrangement hasn¡¯t been previously reported.

¡®An AI icon¡¯
Altman was the closing act at AMD¡¯s splashy ¡°Advancing AI¡± keynote, held at a giant convention center in downtown San Jose in June. After walking onstage to rapturous applause, he shared a quick hug with the chip-designer¡¯s chief executive Lisa Su, before being hit with a somewhat awkward question. 

¡°Can I call you an AI icon?¡± Su asked. 

That day, Altman was dealing with a growing list of seemingly intractable problems, including a political fight over its for-profit restructure in California, that threatened to sink the company. But the rest of the tech world was certainly treating him like one?including Su.

¡°OpenAI has truly been at the center of the universe,¡± she went on to tell the crowd. ¡°Everyone listens to what Sam Altman has to say.¡±

AMD had launched its first line of GPUs specifically designed for AI workloads, called Instinct, in 2018, but struggled to keep up with Nvidia. Su wanted a big AI moment, and felt she was getting close with Altman. OpenAI had worked closely with AMD on the design of its latest chip, MI450, and was optimistic about its potential capabilities. 

When Su asked him if there would ever be enough GPUs, Altman mused that a significant fraction of the Earth¡¯s power should be used to run AI. 

The two companies began talks for a deal for OpenAI to spend tens of billions of dollars buying up to 6 gigawatts of capacity from AMD. Su was willing to give them up to 10% of AMD¡¯s future stock as a reward for taking the chance on her unproven chips, effectively giving OpenAI a massive subsidy.  

In a joint interview with Su, Altman, and OpenAI President Greg Brockman, the Journal asked Su whether she had any anxiety about how much of the tech world¡¯s market cap was riding on OpenAI.

¡°No,¡± Su responded. ¡°What keeps me up at night is getting as much compute as I can to Sam and Greg so that they can really unlock the power of AI.¡±  

After AMD announced its deal with OpenAI on Oct. 6, its stock popped 24%, one of its largest-ever single day gains.

¡°Considering they were so excited about their next-generation product, I¡¯m surprised that they would give away 10% of the company before they even built it,¡± Huang said about the deal on TV. 

Soon after came another announcement: Broadcom said it agreed to build a new chip and computing system with OpenAI engineers. The two sides had been collaborating since early 2024 on the chip, but discussions for a deal accelerated after the Nvidia announcement. 

Broadcom ended up matching the size of the Nvidia deal, offering 10 gigawatts of computing capacity for OpenAI.

A new blood test to aid with the diagnosis of Alzheimer¡¯s disease has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The test, which is designed to rule out cognitive decline caused by Alzheimer¡¯s disease, is the first blood test cleared for use in primary-care settings but not a first for Alzheimer¡¯s.

Elecsys pTau181 ? developed by two pharmaceutical companies, Roche in Basel, Switzerland and Eli Lilly in Indianapolis, Indiana ? measures a specific phosphorylated form of tau, known as pTau181 in blood plasma. The test quantifies how much tau protein in the body has been modified as a result of Alzheimer¡¯s disease.

In a press release on 13 October, Roche reported that in a clinical trial of 312 participants, the Elecsys pTau181 test was correctly able to rule out Alzheimer¡¯s 97.9% of the time. The test uses a negative predictive value and helps to rule out Alzheimer¡¯s in individuals with cognitive decline, rather than giving a positive indication that someone has the disease.


Faster, cheaper, better: the rise of blood tests for Alzheimer¡¯s

¡°Numerous research studies have shown that these blood signatures have high concordance. They agree really well with the gold standard biomarkers of Alzheimer¡¯s disease, which we have been using in specialized settings for many years¡±, says Ashvini Keshavan, a neurologist and biomarker researcher at University College London.

However, without full access to the trial data, Keshavan says it¡¯s difficult to fully assess how accurate the test is. ¡°It would be important to see the sensitivity, specificity and positive prediction values to assess the accuracy of this test.¡±

How accurate is the blood test?
Alzheimer¡¯s disease pathology is characterized by the build-up of sticky amyloid-¥â plaques and tangles of tau proteins in brain tissue. Both proteins disrupt brain function, lead to neuron death and are the causes of cognitive decline associated with the disease1.

One other Alzheimer¡¯s blood test has already been approved to measure these biomarkers in individuals¡¯ blood. In May, Lumipulse, developed by biotechnology firm Fujirebio in Tokyo, gained approval from the FDA. This test measures the ratio of two proteins: pTau217 and amyloid-¥â (1?42). Alicia Algeciras-Schimnich, a clinical chemist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, says the two tests work slightly differently ? with the Lumipulse test able to both positively test for and rule out the presence of Alzheimer¡¯s pathology.

During a trial of 499 people, 97% of individuals who tested negative for the disease on the Lumipulse test had their results confirmed by follow-up diagnostics tests, which measure the levels of these proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue. Almost 92% of those with a positive Lumipulse result for Alzheimer¡¯s disease had positive follow-up tests.

But as accurate as they¡¯re said to be, the blood tests are prone to uncertain results when linking cognitive symptoms with Alzheimer¡¯s. Individuals can fall into a ¡®grey zone¡¯ and require further testing to provide a clear diagnosis.

More than 30% of all samples that were analysed with a pTau217 test developed by Quanterix, a life-sciences company in Billerica, Massachusetts, fell into this grey zone2. A similar number has not been reported for the Elecsys or Lumipulse tests.

Will the tests change Alzheimer¡¯s diagnostics?
Currently, about 92% of adults with mild cognitive impairment might go undiagnosed3. Neurologists have hailed the new blood tests that measure biomarkers of Alzheimer¡¯s to be a major turning point for diagnosing the disease and distinguishing it from other conditions related to cognitive decline.

Previously, the only way to detect these disease-related biomarkers was to perform a lumbar puncture to take a sample of cerebrospinal fluid, or with a neuroimaging technique called positron-emission tomography (PET). Neurologists also rely on clinical assessments of dementia-like behaviours, and personal reports from the individual and their family members to diagnose the disease.

Alzheimer¡¯s blood tests will not replace these other diagnostic tools but they can provide an accessible initial step to find the root cause of cognitive and memory problems when used in combination with other diagnostic tests, says Algeciras-Schimnich.


Blood tests could soon predict your risk of Alzheimer¡¯s

The blood tests should only be used for people who report symptoms of cognitive decline, Kashavan says. ¡°There is a background prevalence of amyloid pathology that increases with age, so just because pathology is present, it doesn¡¯t tell you that it is the cause of the person¡¯s symptoms.¡±

Kashavan adds that more companies ¡°are coming through¡± to make blood tests that will measure various biomarkers for Alzheimer¡¯s disease, ¡°which is a good thing because it means there¡¯s a lot of competition in this space¡±, says Keshavan.

Algeciras-Schimnich agrees, saying that ¡°having more FDA approved tests will increase the access for patients to have early testing and an early answer for their symptoms of cognitive decline¡±.
