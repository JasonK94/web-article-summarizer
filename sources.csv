2,,https://www.wsj.com/business/ballmer-clippers-leonard-sanberg-aspiration-49924b19?mod=hp_lead_pos7,text,"Los Angeles entrepreneur and progressive activist Joe Sanberg was in trouble.

His online bank, Aspiration, had attracted buzz and A-list investors like Robert Downey Jr. and Leonardo DiCaprio with its eco-friendly pitch, but by 2022 it was running out of money. Sanberg had begun falsifying financial documents and concocting phony customers in a scheme he would later admit defrauded investors of more than $248 million.

His dream of springboarding into politics with an antipoverty message was fizzling, too. A $10-million campaign to raise California¡¯s minimum wage, part of a plan to propel him to the governor¡¯s mansion or maybe even the White House, was heading for defeat.

As the pressure mounted, though, Sanberg fixated on closing a deal that bewildered some colleagues: A $48-million endorsement contract between his struggling bank and Kawhi Leonard, an NBA star considered one of the less charismatic members of L.A.¡¯s less glamorous franchise, the Clippers.

¡°Makes no business sense whatsoever,¡± a senior Aspiration executive texted Mike Shuckerow, the company¡¯s general counsel and chief operating officer, after learning of the proposed deal with Leonard, who was riding the bench that season while recovering from an ACL injury.

Sanberg pushed through the deal anyway. Now that contract is at the center of one of the biggest financial controversies in recent sports history. Leonard performed no significant work for the endorsement money, and the NBA has commissioned an investigation into whether the Clippers¡¯ billionaire owner, Steve Ballmer, a former Microsoft CEO and a prized Aspiration investor, used the company to evade league salary-cap rules and pay Leonard through another channel.

The Clippers have denied breaking any rules. Several former senior executives of the bank said in interviews they never heard such a plan discussed. ¡°The notion that Steve invested in Aspiration in order to funnel money to Kawhi Leonard is absurd,¡± the team said in a written statement.

In the basketball world, the controversy has centered on the potential involvement of Ballmer, long seen as a model owner.

After getting his start in venture capital, Sanberg started an eco-conscious bank and aimed to fight poverty. He spoke to students in Compton, Calif., in 2017. Patrick Fallon/ZUMA Press
On Monday, Sanberg is scheduled to appear in a federal courtroom in L.A. to plead guilty to wire fraud in what prosecutors describe as a scheme that defrauded hundreds of Aspiration investors. Two days later, Ballmer¡¯s team will take the basketball court in Salt Lake City to open their 2025 season.

Sanberg hasn¡¯t publicly explained his actions, and his lawyer, Marc Mukasey, declined an interview request on his behalf. ¡°There is a lot of misinformation out there about Joe Sanberg,¡± said Mukasey, adding that a future legal filing would provide ¡°a full picture of who he is.¡±

Star investors
Sanberg co-founded Aspiration in 2013. The bank billed itself as the ¡°financial firm with a conscience.¡± It offered traditional services like other retail banks. It also offered fossil fuel-free investments, donated 10% of earnings to charity and let customers round up to the next dollar on bank-card transactions to fund tree planting.

That pitch attracted a host of celebrity investors?DiCaprio, Downey, Orlando Bloom, Cindy Crawford, Kaia Gerber and the musician Drake. Sanberg wasn¡¯t an Aspiration employee, but he served on its board and acted as a rainmaker. In meetings with prospective investors, Sanberg ticked off the names of his Hollywood investors.

Ballmer may have been the most important name of all. In 2021, he invested $50 million in the company. Weeks later, Sanberg announced a partnership that made the Clippers one of the most important customers of a new carbon-credit business launched by the bank. The Clippers planned to put an Aspiration patch on its jerseys, and there were discussions about putting the bank¡¯s name on a new arena. 

¡°There are few people in the business world and in the sports world that I admire as much as Steve Ballmer,¡± Sanberg said at the September 2021 announcement at the Clippers¡¯ arena, as Ballmer looked on.

Aspiration seemed to be on a roll. A plan to take it public would have valued the company at $2.3 billion, and put Sanberg, its largest shareholder, on track to become a rare type of billionaire?a bleeding-heart liberal who listed his occupation as ¡°anti-poverty advocate.¡±

But things weren¡¯t what they seemed. In a plea agreement Sanberg struck this August with federal prosecutors, he admitted that starting in 2020, his efforts to support the company turned fraudulent.

He borrowed $145 million to aid the company using his own stock as collateral and furnished fraudulent financial statements to lenders to guarantee the transaction, the plea agreement said. Federal prosecutors haven¡¯t accused Aspiration employees of involvement in the fraud.

Sanberg also recruited friends and associates to present themselves as potential customers for the carbon-credit business. Pledges they submitted to unwitting company officials gave a false impression of ¡°explosive growth,¡± allowing him to raise more than $300 million from misled investors, according to a separate Securities and Exchange Commission complaint against Sanberg.

The SEC complaint indicates that most of the bank¡¯s $216 million revenue in 2022 was unconnected to the fraud. Sanberg¡¯s associates said in interviews that they believed he was trying to keep Aspiration solvent until a public offering or other infusion of funds. 

In the basketball world, Ballmer is celebrated for rescuing the Clippers from the messy end to the previous ownership regime, and for pouring his wealth into the roster and a new arena. He had an interest in fighting climate change and wanted the new facility to be carbon-neutral. 

His $50 million investment in Aspiration was like a rounding error for the man whose net worth Forbes calculates at $155 billion, but it gave Sanberg an invaluable boost.

Jay Rogers, the CEO of a family office contemplating a business partnership with Aspiration, recalled sitting up at the mention of Ballmer¡¯s name. ¡°It was like, ¡®OK, this is real,¡¯¡± Rogers said.

He told one political associate that Ballmer had told him that he reminded the billionaire of a younger version of himself. The associate recalled Sanberg saying that he and Ballmer were becoming friends.

A person close to the Ballmer Group, his investment company, said the two hardly knew each other. He said that Ballmer and Sanberg had their first significant interaction at the press conference announcing the partnership between the Clippers and Aspiration.

Success story
Sanberg grew up in Villa Park, an inland neighborhood of Orange County far from the mansions of Newport Beach. His single mom struggled to make ends meet and eventually lost the family home to foreclosure.

A stellar student, Sanberg graduated from Harvard and then went into finance. After a stint at Blackstone, he hit it big as a founding investor in the meal-kit company Blue Apron. 

Sanberg never passed up an opportunity to tell others about growing up, as he once said on MSNBC, in a ¡°in a paycheck-to-paycheck household.¡± In investor pitches and interviews, he said the desire to help people like his mother led him to co-found an environmental bank and get involved in politics.

Facebook posts show him delivering tarps and food to homeless people and protesting after the death of George Floyd. At events sponsored by his charity, he spoke easily with poor mothers and children. 

Even as he talked about the plight of the working class, he often failed to pay people who worked for him, according to several advisers who said they are owed money. A communications consultant, a single mother of three, said she chased him unsuccessfully for months to collect fees.

By 2020, Sanberg was flirting with a long-shot presidential run, explaining to a reporter during an exploratory trip to Iowa, ¡°I would uniquely talk about poverty.¡±

When Bernie Sanders dropped out of the 2020 presidential race, Sanberg snapped up at least four of his advisers as personal political consultants. He and his advisers pursued a 2022 ballot measure to raise California¡¯s minimum wage to $18 an hour. He threw in $10 million, not including the cost of consultants, but failed to meet the deadline to get the issue on the ballot.

Unusual deal
In December 2021, Sanberg told a high-ranking Aspiration executive that the Clippers had approached him about doing a deal with Leonard, their injured star. The executive recalled Sanberg saying: ¡°This is important to the Clippers.¡± 

Aspiration executives learned that Sanberg was advocating for a four-year, $48 million deal with Leonard. Sanberg didn¡¯t control such agreements, but as the largest stockholder and a board member, his preferences carried weight.

Inside the company, jaws dropped at the terms, with one executive telling a colleague that Aspiration could purchase seven Super Bowl ads for the contract price. 

¡°If you want a talent deal¡¦maybe we should shop around. Do some research. Consider a different team,¡± one top executive told Shuckerow, the general counsel, in a text message reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. ¡°You can¡¯t just commit to a $48M spend without talking to people in the company. I don¡¯t get it.¡±

¡°Totally agree,¡± Shuckerow responded. ¡°Kawhi is a regional star. He doesn¡¯t have the charisma of a Steph Curry, Lebron etc.¡±

The deal Sanberg brought the company called for Leonard to receive $20 million in Aspiration stock on top of $28 million in cash, but the company balked at handing over that much equity. In one email to company executives, reviewed by the Journal, Sanberg said then CEO Andrei Cherny ¡°judged the deal not to be worth doing.¡± 

Sanberg then agreed to give Leonard shares from his own holdings, telling executives in an email that they would come to see their error: ¡°The benefits that you¡¦will get from this partnership are subsidized by MY $20 million of stock.¡±

The 19-page contract required autograph signings, meet-and-greets, community-service events and an annual eight-hour day of filming, among other things.

A marketing director reviewing the terms complained in an email to supervisors about ¡°some pretty big flags,¡± including that the man they were paying to introduce the public to their company didn¡¯t use social media. ¡°We should be getting way more than one 8-hr. production day for the price that we are paying,¡± she said.

Company officials considered various strategies for how Leonard might contribute, including a web series in which he tried to reduce his carbon footprint. The marketing department mocked up a Leonard bobblehead with an Aspiration logo.

None of it came to pass, and Leonard was never announced as a spokesman. By the time of the second payment to Leonard, the bank¡¯s financial woes were mounting. The company canceled a long planned ad blitz and stopped paying bills large and small, according to lawsuits filed against the bank.

Former top executives at Aspiration said that although people inside Aspiration had concerns about the deal, there had never been any discussion or speculation by senior executives that it might be a vehicle for Leonard and the Clippers to circumvent the salary cap. 

In the NBA, the cap sets maximums for both teamwide and individual spending on players. It aims to prevent the wealthiest owners from gobbling up all available superstars. NBA commissioner Adam Silver has called cap circumvention ¡°a cardinal sin.¡±

Speculation in the basketball world that the Aspiration deal was a cap workaround flourished partly because of previous allegations involving Leonard. In 2019, when Leonard first signed with the Clippers, the NBA looked into whether the team gave him or his representatives anything beyond a standard player contract. The league found no proof of that.

By late 2022, with Leonard seven months into his endorsement contract, Aspiration was strapped for cash but still expressing optimism to potential investors.

A new chief executive was brought on to pivot the company¡¯s focus from consumer bank to a leaner carbon-credit business aimed at corporations. Sanberg told potential investors he planned to put $50 million of his own money into the company to support that change, which would include slashing the workforce, according to records reviewed by the Journal. That CEO met with Ballmer in November 2022, according to two people with knowledge of the meeting.

The next month, Dennis Wong?a minority Clippers owner whose daughter worked for Aspiration?invested $2 million. In March 2023, Ballmer put in $10 million. A person familiar with the investment said Ballmer intended it as a show of support and confidence for the new CEO.

One of the most influential sports journalists in the country would see it differently. 

Pablo Torre began the Sept. 3 episode of his hit podcast ¡°Pablo Torre Finds Out¡± with a bombshell. He laid out evidence suggesting Ballmer had violated the salary cap by using Aspiration to funnel money to Leonard.

A person Torre identified as an employee of Aspiration¡¯s finance department, his face and voice obscured, recalled being told of the Leonard deal: ¡°It was to circumvent the salary cap. LOL.¡±

The Clippers denied that, but the podcast and a series of follow-up reports went viral. Ballmer told ESPN, in reference to Aspiration: ¡°I made an investment in these guys, thinking it was on the up and up, and they conned me. At this stage, I have no ability to predict why they might have done anything they did, let alone the specific contract with Kawhi.¡± The NBA hired the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz to investigate the matter.

Sanberg¡¯s world, by that point, had come crashing down. In February 2025, he was charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud. His 80-year-old mother signed a $200,000 bond to secure his release on bail.

Aspiration, by then doing business as CTN Holdings, filed for bankruptcy a month later, listing debts of between $100 million and $500 million. The Aspirations stock that Drake, Downey Jr., and some 250 other investors held was almost certainly worthless. 

Sanberg told a federal judge in L.A. last month that he wanted to plead guilty. Under a plea deal, he would admit two counts of wire fraud in exchange for prosecutors seeking no more than 19¨ö years in prison.

In February, Ballmer and the Clippers will be hosting the NBA¡¯s All-Star festivities. If Sanberg is watching, it won¡¯t be from his old courtside seat."
