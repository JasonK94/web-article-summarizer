1.  **Analyze Context**: Read the context.md file thoroughly to understand the project's Primary Goal, the designated AI Model, and any provided References.
2.  **Deconstruct the Goal**: Based on your analysis, break down the Primary Goal into a logical sequence of smaller, actionable sub-goals.
3.  **Propose a Plan**: Present a detailed, step-by-step TODO list that outlines the implementation plan for the *first* sub-goal. For each step, specify which files you intend to create or modify.
4.  **Draft Documentation**: Based on the plan, write a draft for README.md (in English) and README_Korean.md (in Korean) that outlines the project's purpose and planned features.
5.  **Confirm Before Acting**: After presenting the plan and the draft READMEs, ask for my confirmation before you begin writing any code or modifying any files.
