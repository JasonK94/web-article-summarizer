With the recent US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of a second blood test designed to aid in diagnosis, clinicians and patients are gaining more accessible tools to investigate cognitive decline. These new tests represent a major step away from invasive and costly procedures, promising earlier and more widespread assessment.\n\nIn October 2025, the FDA cleared the Elecsys pTau181 test, developed by pharmaceutical companies Roche and Eli Lilly. This marks the second such approval in the same year, following the green light given to Fujirebio's Lumipulse test in May. Both tests work by detecting key biological markers of Alzheimer's in the bloodstream, but they function in slightly different ways.\n\nThe pathology of Alzheimer's is characterized by the accumulation of two proteins in the brain: amyloid-β plaques and tangles of a protein called tau. The new Elecsys test measures a specific modified form of tau, known as pTau181, in blood plasma. Its primary function is to help rule out Alzheimer's as the cause of a person's cognitive impairment. According to a clinical trial of 312 participants, the test was 97.9% accurate in correctly identifying individuals who did not have the disease. This makes it a powerful initial screening tool for use in primary-care settings.\n\nThe earlier approved Lumipulse test takes a different approach. It measures the ratio between two proteins, pTau217 and amyloid-β. This allows it not only to rule out Alzheimer's but also to provide a positive indication of the disease's pathology. In its clinical trial of 499 people, the Lumipulse test showed 97% accuracy in its negative predictions and nearly 92% accuracy for its positive results when compared to follow-up diagnostic tests.\n\nThese blood-based diagnostics are being hailed as a turning point. Previously, the only definitive ways to detect amyloid and tau buildup in living patients were through a lumbar puncture to collect cerebrospinal fluid or a positron-emission tomography (PET) scan of the brain. These methods are expensive, invasive, and not widely available, contributing to a reality where an estimated 92% of adults with mild cognitive impairment may go undiagnosed. Blood tests offer a faster, cheaper, and more accessible first step in the diagnostic process.\n\nHowever, experts urge a clear-eyed view of their role. These tests are not meant to replace existing diagnostic tools but to supplement them. Neurologists will still rely on clinical assessments and patient history to form a complete picture.\n\nFurthermore, the tests are not without limitations. A key challenge is the \"grey zone,\" where test results are inconclusive and require further investigation. For one similar test in development, over 30% of samples fell into this ambiguous category. It is also critical that these tests are used only for individuals already showing symptoms of cognitive decline. As Dr. Ashvini Keshavan, a neurologist at University College London, notes, the presence of Alzheimer's-related proteins can increase with age and does not automatically mean they are the cause of a person's symptoms.\n\nThe arrival of these FDA-approved tests signals a new era in Alzheimer's care. With more companies working on similar technologies, the increased competition is expected to drive innovation and, most importantly, expand patient access to early answers.
